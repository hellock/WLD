1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,040
Further along the shoreline, Thompson's gazelles

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,740
and flamingos xxx drop in. Most elands

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:12,620
had for shade.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,260
A giraffe skip up for some reason in this cesarean sanctuary by the lake

5
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:21,730
at the end of the corridor.

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,300
As seen the leave baboon heading a veritable

7
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,720
army on their wide-ranging quest but anything edible.

8
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:33,970
Which is most things

9
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,060
They're frightened of leopards and take evasive action.

10
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:47,120
Don't they know leopards can climb but they soon

11
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,220
back on lands and now for a really nice surprise

12
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,340
the female giraffe who's made we say died in Hell's Gate

13
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,180
and fed the vultures has given birth here in this sanctuary.

14
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:05,590
cesarean but there seems to be a problem.

15
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,200
It's a mystery why the mother is rejecting the care.

16
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:20,440
Her milk is crucial to their survival.

17
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:27,440
The birth cord is still there.

18
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:48,360
It doesn't look good

19
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,420
There's a distraction some lively warthogs

20
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:58,420
zebra and some impalas.

21
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,040
A sad loss but that's how nature can be

22
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:27,360
reality.

23
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:31,280
But life goes on, the male impala is checking his harem.

24
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:35,020
It is young ones as they all set off from the safety of the lake

25
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:39,940
back up the silent corridor. The augur buzzard from his vantage point above

26
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:40,480
the lake

27
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,160
watches the pelicans move on across the trees searching for more water.

28
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:49,740
Done there the giraffes are also moving

29
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:59,810
Could our female to be getting some attention after her loss?

30
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,070
The recent

31
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,990
rain has produced all sorts of new food in the very green grows.

32
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,950
Flowers like decorate being hedges, a prickly pear,

33
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,110
a reminder that the animals on the move or about

34
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,960
to meet people again. But the people

35
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:22,690
being on a journey doesn't deter them.

36
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:36,910
The impala always seem to have family destruction. There's a lot of chasing

37
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:42,390
calling and tailing.

38
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:49,120
That can lead to a mass jumping effect.

39
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:52,550
Impala males spend a lot of time and energy collecting

40
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,410
maintaining group of females. Something's up

41
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,170
he went to his wives. It is a jackal

42
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:10,170
who is not interested. It is made surprise.

43
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,400
The zebras are xxx.

44
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:29,480
The impalas are competing and two male giraffes

45
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,550
are making ritual fight probably

46
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,550
to establish dominance.

47
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,170
And then come to xxx,

48
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,830
the impalas efforts paid off, so

49
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,120
the Zebras. Yes,

50
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:03,120
that back of the zebras crossing quite relaxed alongside the traffic.

51
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,890
But this cyclist is going to have an interesting ride to work

52
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:17,890
It is a giraffe crossing. One

53
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,350
becomes two becomes

54
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,720
three then four

55
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,110
then five. How do you move

56
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:37,110
five giraffes? He drops something in the frame.

57
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,150
They are behind you.

58
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:49,150
They just keep on coming. After all

59
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:55,100
it is their corridor, There are right a way

60
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,100
in fact should the flower farms fail

61
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:03,170
because of lack of lake water. This investment in wildlife may prove invaluable

62
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,180
to see what animals so confided so easy

63
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:12,400
and so close is a privilege, but they can be hazards as we see.

64
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,520
And the baboons simply don't care

65
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:21,430
Mating in the queue.

66
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:28,020
The corridor can be shared by people

67
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,160
and wildlife.

68
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:36,940
Impalas wait patiently for the right time to cross

69
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,950
Historically,

70
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,060
Local canyons have eaten bush because is a natural food

71
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:47,470
Here both parties seem to have forgotten that the poaching may increase

72
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:53,120
as bush turns into a business. Giraffe skins

73
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:56,730
can be used to make buckets and for the tourist souvenir trade.

74
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:02,740
This is like xxx species but to what extent giraffes can continue to walk

75
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,000
the corridor in safety

76
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:07,070
remains to be seen. Such

77
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,670
is the people pressure. A solution may

78
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,800
surprisingly lie in the hands of shoppers in supermarkets

79
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:18,160
thousands of miles away. That's

80
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,430
if they find out what's happening the lake Naivasha

81
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:28,430
and its water.

82
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,700
For this young giraffe the prickly pear edge

83
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:41,700
is all too affected.

84
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,330
But mostly

85
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:57,740
the migration keep streaming through.

86
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:05,100
The speed bump certainly help.

87
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,640
Numbers of xxx increasing again as the rain

88
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,950
take some pressure off the lamb. The master will always be looking for more

89
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,600
grazing grounds and water supply as a squeeze times on them and their

90
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,450
livestock

91
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,500
to which they are so devoted and on which

92
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:29,230
this so dependent. There is only so much grass and water to go around

93
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,340
although the giraffe have the advantage, they can feed from ground

94
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:38,050
to treat old.

95
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,660
It could be that female who lost her care after mother lake

96
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:46,550
is now back in business.

97
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,840
This may not look too enough to us.

98
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:54,080
Please just what concern a male giraffe on an important signaling device

99
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,360
with hints of things to come. Perhaps back in Hell's Gate National Park

100
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:03,160
when she lost her made to some months ago. The only dangerous

101
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:07,640
animals to her here is man. In the sequence of supply and demand

102
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:14,640
apparently innocent at this time. Behind the green grass

103
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:18,660
the greenhouses squeezs impala and giraffe.

104
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:25,660
Home of the augur buzzard is among the occasions.

105
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,980
This is no abundant wildlife from multiplying warthogs

106
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:39,120
to millions migration white butterflies house with the rain

107
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:43,650
depends on the way the whole watershed is managed from the rain falling on the

108
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,480
mount forest but the lake basin

109
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,830
to the flower growers. The flow workers use it

110
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:52,520
and including increasingly steam power

111
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,990
which is derived from the link water way below ground.

112
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,120
They meet the pylons again,

113
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:06,120
so do the impalas and zebras. They must read their way between the flower

114
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,410
business

115
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:16,410
and the power business. Heading for the safety of Hell's Gate

116
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:24,390
a protected place. What is it?

117
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,850
When the going gets tough the master go grazing

118
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:33,920
sometimes in national parks.

119
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:37,390
And the water is a lifeline,

120
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,660
the stretches all the way for an endangered late called Lake xxxx

121
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:48,660
to the supermarket shopping baskets of Britain and Europe

122
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,940
A cesarean flower farms Waitrose supermarkets

123
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,980
a part of food or water chain

124
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,120
and are being held responsible for the lake. The Waitrose claims it is

125
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,840
a sustainable source. It is not,

126
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,290
but it could be.

127
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,050
Water is the future.

128
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,590
In no way could die lake be considered a

129
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,810
sustainable source,

130
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,150
but it could be. There is a management plan

131
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,220
based on scientific research over 25 years

132
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,650
with a budget to repair the lake and help its people

133
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:54,650
and its wildlife.

134
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,290
If the water goes so does the flower business.

135
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,100
The jobs,

136
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:17,680
the tourism and those giraffes amongst

137
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:24,220
much else.

138
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:30,230
No water nothing left.

139
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,330
When the volcanic ash cloud from Iceland grounded aircraft,

140
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:37,760
thousands of flower workers were laid off and the industry was estimated to be

141
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,350
losing

142
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,890
two million dollars a day. A rose only lives for a week

143
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:47,060
so three million balloons were dumped. That is perhaps

144
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,000
just a warning blip compared with the effect of a dried-out lake.

145
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,980
In April 2010, it was reported that Waitrose supermarket sales rose

146
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:01,660
26.9 percent to 92.2 million pounds.

147
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:08,660
Tesco is thriving to. It would surely be good in the competition that's

148
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,550
increasingly

149
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,390
green in tooth and claw for supermarket to be able to say

150
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:18,820
it's saving the lake.

151
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:25,820
After all the name is on it.
