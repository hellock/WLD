1
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:19,580
It was here, at this moment, she had understood she was watching this queen

2
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,620
solve the puzzle. The key to monkey hunting is to control the high ground,

3
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,370
keep them beneath you and out of the flimsy treetops and to hunt...

4
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,810
down!

5
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:39,060
From that moment on, she knew it too. Command the high treetops, and you have

6
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,060
your monkey.

7
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:26,970
Leopards have an uncanny ability to visualize an ascent in an instant and

8
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,020
mentally plan each foothold before they leap up a thorny tree trunk, with a

9
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:38,310
near vertical incline, all while holding a dead-weight in their jaws. Legadema's

10
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,570
kill is a good one,

11
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,220
the monkey alpha male. It will throw the troop into disarray for weeks, and make

12
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,140
them vulnerable. But even though her meal may last a day or two, they will be even

13
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:58,650
more alert now. This knowledge of how to kill and how to survive, handed down from

14
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:03,870
mother to daughter, is a legacy keeping their bloodline alive from generation to

15
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,620
generation.

16
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:12,040
Lagadema is the only surviving cub of this territory, chosen by fate, to

17
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,040
continue that lineage forward.

18
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:29,580
she was a six month old cub then. Mother and daughter was spending all their time

19
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:33,720
together. they were comfortable, perhaps even enjoying each other as they spent

20
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:40,530
hours playing and hunting together. Legadema was becoming more of a companion

21
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,530
to her mother than just a cub.

22
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,740
On this day she was being shown the boundaries of the territory and

23
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:00,080
everything was new for her. It was her first wet season. Butterflies and flowers

24
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:05,600
danced in front of her eyes, luring her off into the forest, further and further

25
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,600
from her mother.

26
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:22,180
Distraction like this, can mean the difference between life and death in a

27
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,180
place bristling with other predators.

28
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:05,760
Fortunately for leopards, the lions here are too bulky to climb trees.

29
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,780
Legadema's mother had no way of knowing if the growls and hisses in the

30
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,110
distance was Legadema in serious trouble, or not.

31
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:26,360
To survive, she should stay in the treetops but. But as a mother, she needed to

32
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,360
get to her cub.

33
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:48,620
Legadema's mother decided to risk all to get to her cub. Too much excitement

34
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:58,640
for one day, and the Lions barely noticed her discreet exit. Legadema's alert

35
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,640
awareness of the forest has saved her.

36
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:10,940
Together at last, the crisis avoided, mother and daughter released the pent up

37
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,390
tension. The staring danger in the face always brings.

38
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:46,280
The two relieved cats resumed their play, even more connected by their traumatic

39
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,880
adventure,

40
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:55,420
flying through the trees like high wire acrobats, suspended in a world of their own,

41
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:59,820
way above the dangers that lions and hyenas bring down below.

42
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:29,490
Lions or no lions, this was their time to be together. A time to share each other's

43
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,180
elation and each other's pain,

44
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,600
in a way that only mothers and daughters can ever know.

45
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:44,620
Each day, Legadema was adding small pieces of knowledge to her arsenal,

46
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:49,450
Weapons to cope with the harsh world around her and emotions that would guide

47
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:57,100
her through life. Today, this young female with a unique whisker spot is bush wise.

48
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:03,490
Her beautifully patterned fur is like a cloak of invisibility, but one creature

49
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,350
in the treetops always sees through her disguise. It is a constant irritation.

50
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:18,640
From her earliest days, legadema's destiny would be intertwined with these

51
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:24,310
screeching alarmists high up in the forest. Deep within her soul lurked

52
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,290
lethal killer, but at two weeks old... she couldn't quite get the execution right.

53
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:42,790
The mind was willing, but the legs are simply too short. Within her though, the quiet

54
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:58,900
seeds of a squirrel huntress were starting to grow. They taunted her for months with

55
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:06,880
a continual stream of insults from above and she had had enough.

56
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,860
Their time had come!

57
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:45,090
She was focused and ready. At three months old, she was agile enough, no

58
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,200
longer afraid of heights and ready to take her small fight to the battle field.
