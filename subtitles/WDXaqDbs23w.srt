1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
The polar bear, Nanook,

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,920
Ursus maritimu, by any name in this beautiful floor

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,260
of the Arctic.

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,470
Though the polar bear's superiority is not question,

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,850
there is an ancient conflict between people and one of nature's most cunning

6
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:24,490
predators. In the Ottoman, every year conflict erupted to confrontation in a

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,490
little town in Canada's Manitoba province.

8
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:35,070
Hungry polar bears threaten the town and forceful measures are taken to keep

9
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,130
people safe.

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,740
The bears are mixed blessing. On the one hand, they are terrifying pests on the

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,280
other, they are source of revenue of the Churchill's growing tourist trade.

12
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,790
Fierce! Fascinating!

13
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,690
Polar bear is the top carnivore at the top of the world.

14
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:00,930
All other animals here are prey. it's nothing personal. It's just life in the

15
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,760
food chain.

16
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,330
The Arctic wilderness are forbidding realm of snow and ice

17
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,380
for more than a hundred thousand years. The polar bear has reigned supreme as

18
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,380
the Lord of this Arctic land.

19
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,090
Humans have tried to conquer this daunting environment. We've made our mark

20
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,370
but can truly call the land our own. The bear alone is securing in sovereignty

21
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,370
of this harsh frosty world.

22
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:21,120
Exquisitely suited to life in this climate, the polar bear is confident in

23
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,400
its supremacy.

24
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:28,410
while humans rely on inventiveness for survival under extreme conditions. The

25
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,300
bear has evolved its own xxx rules.

26
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,600
for their existence.

27
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:38,070
The affairs of mankind about a source of curiosity indication annoys.

28
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,400
The bear is a serious threat.

29
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,400
People aren't the Kings here where the intruders.

30
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,230
Every year, a singular combination of geography and climate brings Churchill's

31
00:02:53,230 --> 00:03:00,340
1,100 people face to face with polar bears. In winter the bears hunt seals on

32
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,540
the bay ice. In summer the ice melts and the bears must come ashore where there

33
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,810
is no food.

34
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,140
The chill winds of autumn draw the hungry bears northward toward the

35
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,520
approaching ice. Churchill's people like directly in their path

36
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,700
As marine mammal, the polar bear is a marvel of adaptation to a world ice and

37
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,890
frigid water. Bears have been observed to swim as far as 200 miles in the open

38
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,680
ocean. Seals are the principal pray but these voracious meat eater seasonally graze

39
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,810
on seaweed.

40
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:37,220
Arctic foxes are a source of aggravation and amusement.

41
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,950
This is the world's largest land carnivore.

42
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:50,490
an adult male can weigh up to 1,500 pounds. On the xxx legs,

43
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,850
it may stand more than 10 feet tall.

44
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:02,100
The source of myth and legend, the bear is considered by traditional people to

45
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,100
be both worthy adversary and close relative.

46
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,420
One story describes the bears as a race of humans who became bears by dressing

47
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,070
themselves and fur.

48
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,930
When an Inuit woman discovered their secret, they became furious and set out

49
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,930
to kill her and every Inuit sense.

50
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:27,190
The bear's legendary strength is not just stuff of myth. An adult can easily access

51
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,700
seven hundred pounds seal out of its breathing hole and kill it instantly

52
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,700
with one crushing bite from powerful drags.

53
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,920
Females usually give birth to two cubs. In mid-march they emerge from their dens

54
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:48,110
and had for the day ice. In their first year, 6 out of 10 cubs will die from

55
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,110
starvation accidents or predation.

56
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,790
In the spring mothers, with young cubs can easily be tracked on the open tundra.

57
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:07,100
Dr. Ian Sterling is a senior research scientist with the Canadian wildlife

58
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,570
service.

59
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,770
Well, this animal here we can see from the air. She's got to come. She's out

60
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:18,170
of the den .She is fairly lean, so we estimate our way that maybe 350 or 400

61
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,700
pounds and make up a dart for her so that she shall have the right amount of drug.

62
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:28,460
Research scientists have learned that the safest way to handle large dangerous

63
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:32,210
predators is to mobilize them of the tranquilizer dart.

64
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,490
The drug wears off in about three hours and the animal unharmed can continue

65
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,010
about its business.

66
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:45,140
Polar bears are unique to the Arctic, north polar region of the planet. Their

67
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:48,140
ancient ancestors are the brown or grizzly bears.

68
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,440
Remarkably, the polar bear skin is black.

69
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:02,150
Hollow white hair follicles like optical fibers conduct warmth down to the skin.

70
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:10,730
We have the tagged about eighty percent of the adult bears males and

71
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,160
females in this population so this one here

72
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:17,720
she was caught 13 years ago when she was just like these cubs that she's got

73
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:21,770
whether. She had her first cub is pretty pretty young. For now thirteen years

74
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,280
later.

75
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:26,930
In fact almost to the day we've got her with her third letter of of cubs so we

76
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,890
know a lot about to some of these individual bears.

77
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,540
She'll be okay to work with in just a minute.

78
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,630
Cubs are born in midwinter, nursed on their mothers rich milk.

79
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:23,210
They grow rapidly okay. This is gonna to be the wait for cup one. 25 and a half pounds.

80
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,680
Good big family.

81
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:34,880
OK, come, come to, 24 pounds.

82
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,150
Over all around the world polar bears are doing just fine.

83
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,810
Population here and Hudson bay is right on the southern limit of where polar

84
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,780
bears can live so if we're going to be looking at things like the possibility

85
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:50,740
of climate change or other long-term effects were most likely to see them

86
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,360
first in a population that's our living at the limit of its range to start with

87
00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:00,010
The bears in Hudson bay. They are a little bit different from the bears in most

88
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,400
other areas in that they live out on the on the ice and the bay during the winter

89
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:06,580
but it's all annual ice which means that it melts every summer.

90
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,580
So there's a period of four four and a half months every summer that every

91
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,270
bear in Hudson Bay has to come ashore and fast on the fact that it's got

92
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,690
stored on his body and I think one of the consequences if we get climate

93
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:20,290
warming in this area. It is that a breakup will occur earlier. Freeze up will occur

94
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:26,020
progressively later and we'll get more and more bear problems. When problems

95
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,690
between polar bears and people do occur,

96
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:34,720
it is usually in the autumn. Hungry bears going to town looking for food when

97
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,310
confronted by a human. Most bears would rather go the other way but driven by

98
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,820
hunger they become bold. If they decide to attack and eat a person

99
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:50,670
they will. Encounter between a human and a bear is very likely to end with one or

100
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,140
the other debt.

101
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:55,620
Derek Nicrank had a close call right at his front door.

102
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:01,050
I just letting my dog like this when I was going to work one day and he usually

103
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:06,060
runs off and down around the corner. And just when I was stepping down she came

104
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,990
running back this way and I guess what happened. It is a bear had grabbed a bag of

105
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,030
garbage and was eating it around the corner.

106
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,260
Then he came charging up this way I turned around when I seen a bear and run

107
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:19,050
up the stairs and you jumped from the ground right up here.

108
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:23,340
My dog ran into the corner over there and I turned and ran into here like this.

109
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,540
The bear was right here. He got his paws and through the door and I kicked the

110
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:32,430
door closed and that pinched his head between the door jam in the door. And he

111
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,380
just sort of backed out to guess it's under and then I got my shotgun and the

112
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:40,740
bear was right there. And I shout him the first time from here.

113
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:45,510
He stood back up on his legs and I thought he was going to come back up and

114
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:50,310
I shot in place more in the driveway. And then, he is around just a little ways over here

115
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,740
and lay down and died.

116
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:58,840
Lorraine and Danni Allen's scary bear adventure was recorded on videotape by

117
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,220
their nephew, Wayne.

118
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:04,780
I thought the dog was outside and I went to check the door and there was no dog

119
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:09,940
there. It was the bear. Ben and I guess. And then I went to check the window

120
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:10,440
and the

121
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:17,250
bear was banging on the window so I put my hand on the radio on form we need

122
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:22,410
to tell damage to come home. Because there's a bear contacting our house we

123
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:27,510
we got a call over the radio distress call a very high sterically high-pitched

124
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,680
voice stating that a bear was breaking in.

125
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:39,150
So I got a chair and start banging the chair again the floor and screaming at

126
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:45,990
him to stop him from coming in the house and he wouldn't listen.

127
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:51,870
The bear was peeling back the window and next thing that the bear was in the

128
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:57,510
window and then the bear was in the house and that was it.

129
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,510
The radio went silent.

130
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,280
I rushed back and fun rain-out side in her bare feet.

131
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,280
I grabbed my rifle out of the truck and went to the door walked in.

132
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:14,750
Bears have his head on the table eating muffins.

133
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:21,260
It's bacon cupcakes and he smelt the cupcakes and he eat

134
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:26,510
all of the cupcakes. Well, went to my mind I just had to get him out of the house

135
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,260
before I smash the house all of and yeah I couldn't drive mode. You know you just

136
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,480
can't scare my way once they're inside,

137
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,480
so nothing else I could do but you do it.

138
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:44,060
You got here now.There's only one shell in that gun and but luckily or whatever

139
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,830
it is

140
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,600
he died with the first shot.

141
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:52,700
And I don't think anyone here really likes to have to destroy a such a

142
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,840
beautiful animal but in this case here I do believe it warranted it.

143
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,170
There was a human life in danger. In an effort to eliminate fatal encounters

144
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,550
between man and bear, the province of Manitoba, Department of Natural Resources

145
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:14,630
has established the polar bear alert. Each fall when the Bears start moving

146
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,740
towards town,

147
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:20,750
a control zone is established. Bear's found within the zone are captured and

148
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:27,950
placed in a holding facility, popularly known as the polar bear jail. For the

149
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,890
moment this young bear poses no threat,

150
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:34,250
however his irrepressible curiosity could get him in deep trouble.

151
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,240
The polar bear is a constant presence in Churchill.

152
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,940
In the flesh or in its likeness, it permeates the awareness of the people.

153
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,360
Bear is also a source of civic pride,

154
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:03,560
but it also looms as a threat to lives.

155
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,920
Their size and outdoor activities make children the most vulnerable to

156
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:12,220
marauding bears.

157
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,770
Bears are an enduring inspiration and reservoir of income for the native

158
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,330
artists of Churchill.

159
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:32,530
Myrtle the Mules sculpts more than 250 different designs from pieces of caribou

160
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,220
head.

161
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:39,130
It's an art form that's original to her. A talent that was mystically given. it's

162
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,300
a gift.

163
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:44,350
There's no other way I can describe it. I've tried to find a different word for

164
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:52,450
it but it is a gift. So I do all kinds of bears. I do cute bears mad bears bad

165
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,480
bears even ground for bears.

166
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:59,830
When my kids were little, I was very paranoid about bears and during

167
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,450
polar bear season I had them the same recurring nightmares about trying to

168
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:10,870
find places to hide my kids. And the nightmare was that I would be going

169
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,490
through all this

170
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:18,730
this pressure and fear as I'm trying to hide them all. And just when the bear is.

171
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,580
breaking through the house or through a window,

172
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:24,990
that's when I wake up.

173
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,690
The safety of the children is on everyone's mind. My name is Lori Ruth. I'm

174
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:36,600
the natural resource officer here in Churchill and I'm in charge of the polar

175
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,800
bear program.

176
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:41,370
I'm the guy who catches the polar bears in the fall.

177
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:47,250
OK and I keep the bears out of town so it's safe for you guys to play. So I have

178
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,910
some of these the polar bear where booklets with me. But I'll do is I'll

179
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,890
just run through with you again.

180
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:57,150
OK and what to do and what not to do when you meet up with a polar bear.

181
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:03,150
OK so the first thing I never explore bad smelly areas.

182
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:08,640
Polar bears really like garbage so if you smell some garbage etc. The bear will

183
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:12,900
also smell it and that's where he'll head for. Report all bears.

184
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:16,140
If you do see a polar bear, call our bear line.

185
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:22,830
675 bear B E A R and that resource officer will answer the phone and we'll

186
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,600
go in and chase the bear away.

187
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,770
From the first chill winds of September through the November freeze up.

188
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:35,030
Bears are on the move and the Department of Natural Resources is on alert.

189
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:41,810
Culvert traps are placed in areas that bears have been known too frequent.

190
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:49,670
The town's perimeter is regularly patrolled. Fatalities occur when unwary

191
00:15:49,680 --> 00:16:06,860
people stumble across bears sleeping in the brush.

192
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:14,060
Snare traps

193
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:21,560
are placed along known bear migration routes and checked regularly. When a bear

194
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:22,430
is trapped,

195
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,550
it is immobilized with a tranquilizer dart and taken into custody.

196
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,740
This bear was caught on the outer perimeter of our our controls on,

197
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:40,180
so we removed him from the controls on before he entered into town. If you

198
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:43,000
wouldn't call them was pretty good chance you would have made it into town

199
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,720
and we've got himself of all kinds of trouble and probably would end up being

200
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,720
shot.

201
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:54,160
The most of the bears that get into trouble in Churchill are some adults who

202
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:59,830
have not yet become skillful hunters. A starving bear has nothing to lose and

203
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,870
we'll risk anything to feed itself.

204
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,440
This particular bears, a two-year-old which makes up the majority of our

205
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,630
problem bears what it is itself.

206
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,350
These cobs are basically like your teenagers they're cut loose and they

207
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:14,980
don't know exactly what you're doing and so there they wander around aimlessly

208
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:20,920
and and get into all kinds of trouble. So they're our biggest problem bears as far

209
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:27,880
as people bear problems. Before the polar bear alert program was begun in 1985

210
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:32,950
Ten or twelve bears were destroyed every year in defense of human

211
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,540
life or property. Since then, that number has dropped dramatically.

212
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:41,830
Now the bear body count ranges from 0 to only one or two killed.

213
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:50,770
Building d20 is the polar bear holding facility. Mothers with cubs are held here

214
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:54,730
for a day or two. Healthy young adults are kept for no longer than a month.

215
00:17:55,550 --> 00:18:02,080
The accommodations of Spartan but human, the animals are given water but no food.

216
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:05,680
Feeding them would hinder that chance for survival in the wild.

217
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,990
Bears will always be bears. Simple as that.

218
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:16,020
We have to protect the people from bears but we also have to protect the bears

219
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,280
from people.

220
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:22,910
For those who want to go to Georgia to see polar bears, there are only two ways

221
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,230
to get there.

222
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,230
No roads like the town with the outside world.

223
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:33,130
The lure of the first hand look at the great white bear draws people from all

224
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,930
over the world to this little outpost on the tundra. Churchill is a

225
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,230
two-and-a-half-hour plane flight from the provincial capital of Winnipeg.

226
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:47,690
The train trip is a grueling two-day journey.

227
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,990
Interest in polar bears and in polar bear souvenirs approaches of mania

228
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,220
during the October November peak bear season. Though the bears can be

229
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:47,710
frightening. The visitors, their tracks are seen as mostly good for the town.

230
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,430
To us

231
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,120
the locals we've not only learn to co-exist to the bear.

232
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,210
Now it's bringing so many people.

233
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:59,560
It's attracted so many people from all over the world who are kind of like

234
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,310
we're really proud to be able to see well we are the polar bear capital of

235
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,150
the world.

236
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:09,250
We're not about to tell you don't come here it's dangerous. You know if you take

237
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:14,200
this that the necessary precautions and you listen to your tour guides.

238
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:18,730
There's no reason why you can't have an a nice safe trip and see the most beautiful

239
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:24,940
bear world. The best and safest way to see a polar bear close is from a

240
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,460
Tundra Buggy.

241
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,290
These monster machines take visitors out on to keep Churchill in the heart of

242
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,290
polar bear country.

243
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:52,790
The bears are as curious about the tourists as the tourists are about the

244
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:57,830
bears. Face-to-face encounters between bear and human are not uncommon.

245
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,290
Polar bears don't seem aggressive or dangerous.

246
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,290
They don't stakeout or defend the territory.

247
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:14,720
They are absolutely secure in their role as Lords of their domain.

248
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,320
For most of their lives, polar bears are solitary hunters. Ferocious denizens of

249
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:28,820
the icebound sees fearsome stalkers of the Arctic winter night.

250
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:32,840
Surprisingly when not competing for food or mates,

251
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:37,580
polar bears are quite social and engage in complex interactions that positively

252
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,580
delightful visitors to polar bear country.

253
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,520
Polar bears are long lift, very intelligent and learned from experience.

254
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,530
It is likely that they recognize each other and play with the same friends

255
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,710
season after season.

256
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:11,230
When you're looking at an animal that size it's quite a rush I mean but close

257
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,640
for the first person ever seen.

258
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:15,730
We're going to definitely has some uncomfortable feeling about it.

259
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:22,420
Here is a big bear. Reached over there right over the top of the glass.

260
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:26,020
That's not so bad but when they back up and start to get on the glass you gotta

261
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:32,170
gotta move along so just let them do their own thing. Obviously we're not here

262
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,590
to see them

263
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,590
that they're not out here to see us.

264
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:45,540
The first Tundra Buggy was built in 1980 by master mechanic and

265
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:52,080
back of nowhere engineer Lens Smith. Len cobble together a hand-built cabin to

266
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:55,830
four-wheel drive truck chassis to make a vehicle that could take a couple of

267
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,830
dozen people out onto the tundra.

268
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,230
Importantly,

269
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,170
to bring them back.

270
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,520
First began to build held 26 people

271
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:08,760
and now my largest one holds 50.

272
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:11,760
So it's double in size,

273
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:17,000
not an engineer so I did made everything about 10 times stronger than it should

274
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:17,480
be.

275
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:23,210
But a lot of stuff that came from the factory wasn't strong enough side design

276
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:28,670
lot of stuff that steering cylinders hoses for protection from one's rights

277
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:33,590
and that tires breaking beads. I had a designer that wouldn't break the

278
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,730
beads.

279
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:39,380
It took quite a few years before I got morning's all the little things that

280
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,340
went wrong

281
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:46,250
down to where I don't have much problems now. Len's goal is for his guests to enjoy

282
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,240
a safe

283
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,450
polar bear adventure.

284
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:53,770
The ultimate experience is the Tundra Buggy camp that he sets up a cape

285
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:59,050
xxx. xxx a fortune of polar fan can spend a week or two living amid

286
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:02,590
and learning about the fabled king of the ice.

287
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,780
The open tundra is a hostile environment.

288
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:12,100
Temperatures fall well below zero degrees exposed human skin can freeze

289
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:15,170
within minutes but to a polar bear

290
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,960
this is a comfortable home.

291
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:21,340
Once Smith works tirelessly to keep his guests warm and well feel

292
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:26,450
in the two weeks spent at the Cape Churchill camp he will burn around 2,000

293
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,910
gallons of propane.

294
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,600
A week or two in close quarters,

295
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:34,170
group of strangers

296
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:38,430
in the middle of a vast ice field and surrounded by marauding carnivores is

297
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,430
not everyone's idea of a fun vacation.

298
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,580
But the adventurous travelers of the Buggy camp love the experience and many

299
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:49,580
are repeat customers.

300
00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:02,010
The bears are nearing the end of their annual for month fast even dishwater has

301
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:05,010
some attraction to a hungry bear.

302
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:10,260
I've never got tired of watching bears, says it's always something new every

303
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:13,350
year. They they act different they do something different

304
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:22,200
It's never boring watching polar bears. I can't imagine season going by without my

305
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:27,120
coming to see the cave Churchill of polar bears. award-winning photographer and

306
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:33,390
author Dr. Dan Garbage created the Tundra Buggy tour. If one can say you

307
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:38,610
love an animal without being accused of being an to the anti-morphic. I would say that

308
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,750
I have that kind of relationship with these these magnificent creatures.

309
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:48,900
They're beautiful and intelligent and if you stay around a place where there's

310
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:50,610
polar bears for very long,

311
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:57,240
you'll begin to appreciate them just how intelligent they are.

312
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:01,590
The adults don't need protein because they finished lowing.

313
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,090
I don't know whether it's more exciting to see the polar bears are more exciting

314
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:14,700
to see the people. They get so wrapped up in what they see that it's just so very

315
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:17,700
very exciting.

316
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:46,840
1976, I met two remarkable animals.

317
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:57,880
One was the polar bear and the other was here looking at. Through the

318
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,680
endless Arctic night,

319
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:03,370
ancient people would huddle around the flickering oil-lamp and tell tales of

320
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:07,360
bear, a creature of mythic strength and epic proportions.

321
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:11,980
the old man, ancestor, teacher, the burner of winter.

322
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,450
Kubiak,

323
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:18,940
the ten-legged bear beast. They already have either warm not cold

324
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:26,560
these and day. Our fascination with bears lies deep within our human experience of

325
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:30,160
all the ancient animal Gods. Only bear was unlimited and its powers.

326
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:41,040
In bears we may instantly recognized kinship a fellow being over his

327
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,670
obligations communication.

328
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,330
Familiar mannerisms and need to dominate his living space.

329
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,960
Polar bears have a complex social structure. Females will aggressively

330
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:55,960
defend their cubs against any intruders.

331
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:04,920
There are especially ways of large males who are known to kill and eat cubs.

332
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:14,020
This adult male weighs over 1,000 pounds

333
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:18,970
but is being persistent, we pursued by a female about one-third his size.

334
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:24,160
It would see that the male could easily overpower and kill the spirit of female

335
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,160
but instead  he won't.

336
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:38,300
What's settled their etiquette is in play here. It is a fight with a combative

337
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:41,060
female too risky to the male's own survival.

338
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:45,830
We can only speculate and watch as their showdown is transformed into an elegant

339
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,770
and powerful model.

340
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:01,990
Finally, in a gesture of submission he surrenders, to heard offensive onslaught.

341
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:10,790
The polar bear alert is a waiting game.

342
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:18,830
Hold on tomorrow mark winds from the Northwest 60 kilometers an hour actually

343
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,830
get them very xxxx.

344
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:32,100
For the natural resource officers, it's not a question of if but there will come

345
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:35,100
to town but when.

346
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:43,580
Hello, bear alert.

347
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,810
I get your name please.

348
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:57,310
Very good thank you, bye.

349
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,310
We got a bear between terrible hall in the Complicate.

350
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:09,050
Drawn by the irresistible smells and sounds of the town,

351
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:13,580
a hungry and fearless young bear has come ashore near the school and

352
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:18,500
community center. A potentially dangerous situation for the many people who

353
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,950
frequent the area.

354
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:44,880
Natural resource officers try to scare the bear away with flash crackers fired

355
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:48,210
from a shotgun but it is not easily frightened.

356
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:54,250
The intruder is observed for a short time

357
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:58,510
and a decision is made to dart and place the bear in protective custody until the

358
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,510
bay freezes.

359
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,890
For the local people it's not a pleasant thing to have to worry all fall about

360
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:41,350
your kids, especially Halloween. Halloween is the most dangerous time of the year

361
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:47,830
and there's always a lot of apprehension about that the bears which are always

362
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,560
just skirting your skirts of tone.

363
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:54,430
So what should you do if you see a polar bear? Walk backwards and no stop.

364
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,180
Right, keep your eye on them, you turn around and run

365
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:02,110
What's about your bag of candy?

366
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,980
Look like you able to do with that. Don't drop it, just dump it all.

367
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:10,360
You throw candy away from a bear and then you eat one that he goes after

368
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:13,480
another one will have a problem back here and then you just run.

369
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:17,770
Why don't run back at school I guess. So you're going to throw your candies to

370
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:18,940
xxx the bear.

371
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:22,270
Yeah thrown them behind.

372
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:27,160
Well I think if it's a choice between your candy styling and your life.

373
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,390
Don't double.

374
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:32,380
I pick my candy. And I don't think so

375
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:36,370
Here's a question for you should you going on Halloween dressed like a

376
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:43,630
polar bear.

377
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:51,780
Halloween is celebrated in the midst of bear season and darkness comes early to

378
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:54,780
the far north.

379
00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:01,380
Wary Boon e has a brief window of time to make a final check for bears in town

380
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:07,650
before eagle trick or threatens flood the streets and alleyways. Like kids all over

381
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:12,180
North America, Churchill's usually love the annual ritual of costumes and

382
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,040
house-to-house begging for treats.

383
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:17,160
No bear is going to spoil their fun.

384
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:20,160
The town's adults are there to ensure it.

385
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:41,820
Lots of kids and moving around moving around on the streets and there's a

386
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:44,700
large number of bears massing right now and keep Churchill

387
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:48,450
so definitely if polar bear would come to town, it could be a dangerous situation.

388
00:33:52,740 --> 00:34:05,420
Be careful work for the day.

389
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,740
You're gonna freeze out here yes you are coming winter time.

390
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:17,740
Don't go anywhere.

391
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:22,170
All quiet in the local cemetery.

392
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:43,350
All quiet. As long as you don't get bigger then the fox, no problem. Without

393
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,190
warning,

394
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:47,730
something moving, your pulse quickest.

395
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:50,940
Your brains works wrong. Fear grips your guy.

396
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:58,250
Just another kid in a costume, a prankster who didn't get the message

397
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:01,850
a foolish trick in a town that is on high alert.

398
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,850
White shapes walking in the shadows.

399
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:08,660
You are not supposed to be running around like this

400
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:14,220
when your butt shot. That's your brain matter where it's something like that in

401
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:17,220
it.

402
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:25,350
Brian Lagoon raises and breathe we're Canadian sled dogs at an isolated spot

403
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:31,020
on the shore of Hudson Bay. Surprisingly he's not worried that his dogs are

404
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,600
living in the heart of polar bear country.

405
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:38,040
These dogs are Canadian Eskimo Dogs there

406
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,600
One of candidates for his grades and we keep the most here,

407
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,600
spring summer and fall and the natural environment.

408
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:50,130
This is very good for them that's the best way to keep them. Any other way

409
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:58,620
they don't feel safe and secure. Brian's dogs are pack animals they prefer living

410
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:02,250
close together and rely on one another to sound a warning when danger

411
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,270
approaches.

412
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:08,700
I don't necessarily keep the dogs in the bears away from each other what I do is

413
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,190
I set a standard that when I'm on the premises

414
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,540
the bears know that they move away from me and keep at a distance so I can come

415
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:20,550
out into my work and my feeding and my chores and stuff like that. So I mean I'm

416
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:24,990
careful with the bears but I'm tough with them. They know that I'm at the

417
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,380
greater danger to them than the dogs. I make it that way that I am the greater

418
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:30,160
danger.

419
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:34,660
And so they see me and they put head get over their shoulder and they're

420
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:37,330
looking for that guy again me. Okay.

421
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:42,490
These dogs are OK well he's crazy. To a half-ton meat eater but hasn't had a

422
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,050
meal for months.

423
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:48,220
The dogs must look like a smorgasbord. I know that bears are they're carnivores

424
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:51,640
and all the other stuff too close with him but they still have personality so

425
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:56,860
you can judge characters of bears in all the body language and so forth and I've

426
00:36:56,870 --> 00:37:00,790
learned to be cautious. Has one thing around them

427
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,180
you can't let your guard down with them, there's still a dangerous kind of work.

428
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:11,200
You know they have their brutal moments. Once walked from powerful Paul could

429
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:14,200
instantly kill the aggressive dogs.

430
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:20,930
The first 10 years I thought the dogs heavy aggression against the bears and

431
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:28,100
it was much more brutal and savage. Now it's a very more mellow coexistence

432
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:31,100
because the dogs don't look at the bears as such great enemies.

433
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,250
In the far north bears and dogs have a magical connection.

434
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,140
In one native legend an angry bear is surrounded by snarling dogs,

435
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:53,560
as he strikes out of them. Bears and dogs begin to glow brightly and wise up into

436
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:56,980
the sky to become the stars of the Great Bear constellation.

437
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:03,770
Why this hungry bear doesn't devour the dog is anybody's guess

438
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:10,010
whatever the reason they seem to have achieved a working peace agreement.

439
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,860
In the company of bears there stands a magic clock,

440
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:25,720
it doesn't talk her tick and it doesn't take her talk, but it shows you you have

441
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:27,340
all the time you need

442
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:33,850
with just what time you've got. So with bears you can be almost anything

443
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:38,020
Colorado artist Barbara Stone has immersed herself in the life floor of

444
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:42,040
polar bears .For they only see you for who you are

445
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:52,240
Whether she renders them realistically or places them in the whimsical settings

446
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,650
for which she is famous.

447
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:56,650
The bears are her artistic inspiration.

448
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,680
She sees them as a metaphor for experiences in everyday life.

449
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:12,120
What impresses me about seen more polar bears, a new polar bear in the landscape

450
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:17,340
is how different their personalities are. Because you see aggressive bears and

451
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:23,370
swells very timid bears. And I think the important thing about sketching on the

452
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:29,370
landscape is seeing the bear as a part of the landscape rather than may be working

453
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,670
from photographs at home little bear is just isolated by being in the

454
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,750
environment.

455
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,350
I think I get more of a sense of how their fits into the landscape.

456
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:43,740
I've been painting polar bears for four years before actually saw one in the

457
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:48,300
wild and I was curious and the people that were aware of my work wondered how

458
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:54,690
my work might change when I actually saw bear in the wild but I found that when

459
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:59,370
I saw and it was actually more amazing and magical that I had even imagined

460
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:02,370
them in my work.

461
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:06,900
It is the magic of bears in relation to human life that intrigues Barbara

462
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,980
by placing bear isn't typically human situations.

463
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:15,520
Barbara offers a different perspective from which to gain insight into our own

464
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:20,050
lives. On the simpler level,

465
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:23,230
many people just find her work incredibly charming.

466
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:27,880
The first time I saw polar bear was in a the vehicle and there were five people

467
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:33,160
in the vehicle, my daughter was one of them and I was next to the window so I

468
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:37,390
was able to find myself. I do I with this bear with his nose right against the

469
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,110
window right it might shoulder and it was just thrilling to to be that close

470
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:44,980
to bear space that actually make eye contact with it. Then

471
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:49,330
my daughter was sitting next to me lean forward in the bear notice term made eye

472
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:53,800
contact with her. She's right here it's kind of pounding a little bit.

473
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:57,730
It finally turned his head as far as it could make eye contact with each person

474
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,840
in the vehicle

475
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:02,620
what really impressed me about that is I realize that I had made eye contact with

476
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:07,030
all the people in the vehicle. But it know that we were all separate beings

477
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:12,490
and it wanted to identify as each. So I was quite impressed by that

478
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:19,540
You're not really supposed to do that.

479
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:23,020
Does anybody have any stories about bears and once that you've seen?

480
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,550
I was at my cabin and we hear this

481
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:35,590
like it was a bear and then I don't know stranding the cap and then my mom is

482
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:42,010
just a dog growing up. We always used to go to the jump in my we on my mom had a

483
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:46,600
truck and and then there was a bear climbing up with garbage in his mouth

484
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:49,600
and he was running after the truck.

485
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:02,900
This mother and her cubs have not had a successful hunt.

486
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:09,600
The bay ice is still thin constantly moving. The female leads her young ashore

487
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,600
to drop into the dump for between seal snack.

488
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:39,690
On a routine patrol the area near the dump,

489
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,690
officers discovered the mother and cubs.

490
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:49,160
The bears are darted and taken to the holding facility to be measured and

491
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:50,030
tagged.

492
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,360
Since the jail is nearly full

493
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:56,360
they'll only be held overnight.

494
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:07,040
A polar bear airlift is a big attraction for locals and tourists alike.

495
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:13,070
People can't resist getting a first-hand look at bears unconscious ones.

496
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:19,100
This hungry trio will be released to the wild far from the town and its

497
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:21,670
temptations.

498
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,760
Except for being absolutely filthy from their dump adventure

499
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:28,420
these cubs are in very good condition. Their mother has cared for them well,

500
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:31,630
They're going to take some bears.

501
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:37,290
The very compound here and they're going to use the helicopter to transport them

502
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:43,350
away from the town site. How far to take away? Probably take about 20 25 miles up

503
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:48,930
the coast north. In about two hours these cubs and their mothers will be awake and

504
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:53,070
headed for the bat ice. The cubs will spend the winter honing their hunting

505
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,800
skills and learning the ways of polar bears.

506
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:59,070
Now these is a very our problem in the community before enter. They worry

507
00:43:59,080 --> 00:43:59,820
appetites.

508
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:04,290
They were got some are close to the community tranquilize that and put in

509
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:11,130
jail, bad bears. The nobleman or doesn't look so ladylike wrapped in a cargo net

510
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:14,850
drug to a stupor the helpless victim of human progress.

511
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:22,320
What will happen to her kind as humans penetrate ever more deeply her frosty

512
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:28,650
kingdom. Once pure season our toxic soup filled with an alphabet of chemicals

513
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:34,240
the Inuit natives of this region are believed to be the most highly

514
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:39,400
contaminated humans on earth. Mother's milk is poisoning babies.

515
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:47,380
Polar bears have seven times or more of the same toxins in their bodies.

516
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:58,010
In late November falling temperatures and a frigid northeast wind finally

517
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:01,010
bring the pack eyes to the western shore of Hudson Bay.

518
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:07,630
As suddenly as they appeared, the bears will soon disappear into the crack bay

519
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:10,630
ice.

520
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,910
Free of time for the jail bears

521
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,360
Calven traps are used to transport them to the bay shore where they'll be

522
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:23,360
released.

523
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:38,880
A few weeks in jail have not dulled this bears curiosity or perhaps his taste for

524
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:40,480
humans.

525
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:47,100
Every effort is taken to make the bears encounter with people as unpleasant as

526
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:49,200
possible.

527
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:53,370
The object is to teach the bear to avoid people.

528
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:12,280
Like a skiff of windblown snow, the bears are abruptly God. The short season of

529
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:17,560
fear is over. The bear watches have migrated south. Their photo albums

530
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:19,530
crammed with memories.

531
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:22,530
Churchill has returned to its tranquil routine.

532
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:29,490
The bears are back in the watery world of sea ice and fat seals over which they

533
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,490
are such transcendent masters.

534
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:37,560
However this realm is unsettled and uncertain as its surface.

535
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:43,290
Global forces are at play the possess a power greater than that of the bears.

536
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,990
If the king should someday be toppled by environmental change

537
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,890
what would it say about the survival of the subjects.
