1
00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.859
All three species of North American
bears are found here,


2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.529
brown bears, black bears and polar bears.


3
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.559
My name is Chris Morgan. I have dedicated
half my life to the study and


4
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:27.359
conservation of bears. Now, I’ve embarked upon
a 3,000 mile journey into the heart of


5
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.029
the Bears world with me my good friend
and filmmaker Joe Pontecorvo. You don't


6
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.329
notice it’s cold until you look at your
filmset and you see frost over


7
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.479
everything. Together


8
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.639
our goal is to peel back the layers of
myth and misunderstanding on this


9
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.209
complex creature. See our glance, I put this in 
our place in it. To better understand


10
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.479
their personalities, all our theories out the
window to witness firsthand how they


11
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.099
live today


12
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.138
and what the future might hold for the
bears of the last frontier.


13
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:18.988
My journey has taken me through the
season of the brown bear and black bear


14
00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.908
from an area nearly untouched by man


15
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.649
to the most urban environment in Alaska.
Now at the very edge of the North


16
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.099
American continent, a new adventure is
about to unfold.


17
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:49.199
I leave behind the cold metal and steel
of Prudhoe Bay and head to the home of


18
00:01:49.200 --> 00:02:05.369
the polar bear. my plane touches down on
a four-mile long windswept strip of land


19
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:12.959
known as Barter Island on the edge of
the Beaufort Sea. Fewer than 300


20
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:19.649
residents mostly Inupiat Eskimo call
this remote island home but they are not


21
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.639
alone.


22
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.509
They share this frigid coastline with another
great hunter, the polar bear.


23
00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.629
While the rest of the bears have denned
up for winter, polar bears sense the


24
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.469
change in season and are anxious for the
chill to set in.


25
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.119
Polar bears are ice loving creatures


26
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.448
and from an early age they are drawn to it,


27
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.339
investigating any new formations on the
water.


28
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.999
What fascinating to me about these
polar bears is that there's some finally


29
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.609
tuned and adapted to life of ice.


30
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.259
This looks like a bear is running right
down this trail here and he's broken


31
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.499
through here. Look it’s paw actually
broken through this ice here. In fact the ice


32
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.089
starts to form already, so there forever
testing the ice conditions to see if


33
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.089
it's firm enough for them to head out
onto and it's not yet obviously.


34
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.519
As adults they depend upon ice to hunt.


35
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.879
Unlike brown bears, polar bears are
highly specialised carnivores and hunt


36
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.268
almost exclusively one animal, seals.


37
00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:11.017
The ringed seal look nervously around,
exposed on this open expanse but without


38
00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.608
thermal advice this bear has little
chance to hunt down the seal.


39
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.639
Tt's late October and by now the ocean
should be frozen over.


40
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:32.219
But this year, winter has come late. Part
of the Laguna covered with ice, but the


41
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:42.569
ocean has yet to be tamed. For now, the
bears are trapped on land unable to hunt


42
00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.279
Locals call this area the polar bear
campground.


43
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:07.339
It's a nursery of swords, a safe haven
for mothers and young. This time of year


44
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.309
when other polar bears are waiting for
sea ice to form, pregnant females are


45
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.959
waiting for enough snow to dig their
maternity dens. This whole area in fact


46
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.169
is really important for denning females
when they're pregnant they come and give


47
00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.859
birth in the habitat along this coast
here near the Arctic National Wildlife


48
00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:36.889
Refuge. So many the females return to
the same area to raise their cubs.


49
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.509
They seem to have this recognition when
the cubs playing, females playing and


50
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.138
one cub is playing with another cub.
From its, it's quite the interesting


51
00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:53.138
scenario that's going on.


52
00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:06.149
That guy make a beeline right for us.
Actually we've only been here a few


53
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.299
minutes and already we've attracted some
attention.


54
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.098
I'm directly up win from her. She got
her nose in the air and she can catch my


55
00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:20.098
scent.


56
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.749
And she's coming this way, we probably won't
have a very long before we have to make


57
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.158
a hasty retrieve. You know the most
predatory of the bears and there is


58
00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:32.668
capable of great speed is grizzly bears
are. You know they can run 35 miles an


59
00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:35.668
hour so.


60
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:46.689
I think it's time to get in the boat.
She’s moving over here with some


61
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.689
determination. We need to make a retrieve here.
You want to jump on go?


62
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.579
Yeah, it looks like it's getting a really
agitated, she can mile us but she can't


63
00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.959
access us,can't figure out for a meal or
not and it's how they live their lives.


64
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:08.409
They are curious predators. Everything
about them is about surviving the cold


65
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:17.169
and hunting seals. Being a specialist,
the key to surviving the Arctic, it is


66
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.379
true for the bears as it is for the
Inupiat Eskimos.


67
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.959
Centuries these two hunters of the
Arctic of, made their living from the


68
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:36.639
ocean. The lives connected by the animals
they hunt. Twice a year in spring and for


69
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:43.629
the Inupiat Eskimos hunt bowhead whales
to discard it remains are left on this


70
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.629
bone pile.


71
00:07:54.590 --> 00:08:01.639
Seven o'clock in the morning would wear
on the outskirts of town and there's a


72
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.269
good spot to wait for bears right here
because there seemed to like coming out


73
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.039
of the cover of darkness.


74
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:11.659
Sometimes it's a case of waiting around
a long time for themselves are what we doing


75
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.019
right now. Let's see if any show up,
fingers crossed.


76
00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:58.369
This guy is some, closes we want to
get. The whale meat with high fat content


77
00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:03.889
may help some bears get through these
tough times when there's little else to


78
00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:10.669
eat. If warming trends continue,
competition for this small pile of food


79
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:18.259
could get fierce for a species already
on the brink. Polar bears will have some


80
00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.259
tough times ahead.


81
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:30.989
An overnight snow flurry leaves fresh
drift for this young arctic fox to play


82
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.989
in.


83
00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:46.529
The icy lagoon is full of activity, the
bears use this new platform to practice


84
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:53.879
their light as a feather walk. Sea-ice
unlike fresh water ice is flexible which


85
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.879
gives the bears a lot to experiment with.


86
00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:07.179
The fibres baleen whales used to filter
their food has become the perfect toy


87
00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:09.759
for these young cubs.


88
00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.759
yeah


89
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:22.099
Play attracts attention and quickly
their mom claims the large baleen to


90
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.099
strip out what she can from it.


91
00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:40.009
With the bone pile nearly exhausted, this
mother frantically digs for scrapped


92
00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:46.009
buried in the snow, but her fine soon
draws attention from another family.


93
00:10:53.080 --> 00:11:07.509
Tensions are high as bears uncover every
last bit of whalebone, scraping what meat


94
00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:10.509
they can from the bones.


95
00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:25.929
I find like this is worth protecting


96
00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:32.709
and this mother bear is not about to
give up her meal so easily.


97
00:12:18.019 --> 00:12:21.018
This young bear will have to seek out
his own meal.


98
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.259
Fortunately for him, the weather appears
to be getting worse.


99
00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:39.179
Temperatures have dipped to a
bone-chilling 20 degrees below. Greece


100
00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:42.179
ice is starting to cover the water


101
00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:47.119
and winds batter the tiny island.


102
00:12:54.490 --> 00:13:04.958
The town is battening down the hatches
as the storm sets in. Once ice begins to


103
00:13:04.959 --> 00:13:08.319
form, the ocean freezes over in just a
few days.


104
00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:51.279
Winter has finally taken hold, the town
now in its final days of sunlight. It's


105
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:55.239
farewell to the bears as they head out
onto the pack ice to hunt.


106
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:07.919
The Sun will vanish below the horizon
and not reappear for another two months.


107
00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.909
For now, the world is in darkness.


108
00:14:21.329 --> 00:14:32.068
Miles out on the pack ice, polar bears
are hunting seals, stalking their prey


109
00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:35.367
and the inky blackness of winter.


110
00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:58.108
Near the end of January, the Sun begins
to reappear.


111
00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:05.019
I.t’s a time of transition


112
00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:08.019
with more light each day.


113
00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:13.768
And by May in mid-Spring, the sun is up
24 hours a day


114
00:15:17.329 --> 00:15:20.328
and it's safe enough for us to venture
out onto the pack ice.


115
00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:27.389
We nearly eight miles out on a thin
shelf of ice


116
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:31.549
searching for polar bears,


117
00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:42.399
but I'd be foolish to attempt this alone.
Dale Brower grew up on the North


118
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.789
Slope. Maybe we'll get on a high point look
around.


119
00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:51.039
Meaning he grew up in a world completely
alien to most of us.


120
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:56.679
He's a really fresh because that
actually on top of our sledtracks from


121
00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:00.819
about five hours ago, maybe even four
hours ago, so they weren't here then


122
00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.079
that's for sure.


123
00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.829
He might have heard the snow machine and
then kind of snuck back off into this


124
00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:14.199
these pressure ridges here and he could
just be hiding out in these. In this


125
00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:19.779
featureless white landscape, it's the
bears to have the advantage. Problem is


126
00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.419
if they're off in the distance right
there behind the ice to get easily


127
00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:28.029
obscured even a large animal like a
polar bear. Is this a weather front


128
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:29.229
coming in here?


129
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:34.149
Yeah, that's actually the water sky
that's their water from the open lead


130
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:37.659
reflecting into the sky. So if you had it into


131
00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:42.579
those clouds, you find open water? 
Open a water underneath. And there's


132
00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.579
a good chance for the polar bears that
we’re tracking here.


133
00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:24.719
Tt's been an exhaustive search and still
the bear remains elusive.


134
00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:34.139
Why are you checking which way the winds
blow? Just so the entry way is on the


135
00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:39.179
opposite end. All right. We don't want it
facing the wind right? I guess that's


136
00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:48.149
really important when it blew it for 50
miles an hour everyday. I can already


137
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:59.369
set the tent. Our camp is modest but
functional in every way. I'm discovering


138
00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:02.458
there's little that Dale does that
doesn't relate directly to our own


139
00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:10.859
survival even the caribou hide seemed to
be the perfect insulation against the


140
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.599
cold.


141
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:18.299
Yeah kinda yeah good fits in a little better
like it’s a big photo


142
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:39.449
Huh white. What is that?


143
00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:44.189
That's my full of here. It's the best
for out there as if it's for keeping


144
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:45.089
the wind out.


145
00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:51.298
Oh yeah, it keeps the wind out and then it
doesn't really, it doesn't frost so it


146
00:18:51.299 --> 00:18:55.349
doesn't collect snow and stuff.
Interesting. And then it stays pretty


147
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:59.668
clean even though you get it dirty, can
just wipe it in the snow and the hair


148
00:18:59.669 --> 00:19:04.829
will just clean itself, basically like a
polar bear after its done with its kill.


149
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:10.019
Just rubbing the snow, take a snow bath
and then just take all the dirt off


150
00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.019
fur.


151
00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:27.539
Polar bears are stealth hunters and just
because you don't see them, doesn't mean


152
00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:32.459
they're not there. See what we can do,
I’ll break my ankles.


153
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:44.219
Yeah, perfect vantage point as I was
saying the perfect vantage point for


154
00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:49.859
looking for polar bears are cameras
right here, it's easy to forget this mack


155
00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:57.149
bank right in the middle of polar bear
habitat. All the way to the horizon, all I


156
00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:04.319
can see is ice, giant jagged peaks and
troughs of ice as far as you can see and


157
00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:09.329
it is a barren hostile landscape if you
can't read the ice here, you're not going


158
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:10.408
to survive.


159
00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:17.909
Polar bears are masters at reading the
ice, patrolling the edge of a lead,


160
00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:20.909
smelling for any trace of a seal.


161
00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:34.769
But sneaking up on a seal in open water
is a challenge, even for a polar bear.


162
00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:55.429
The best chance for a meal is to sniff
out a seal’s breathing hole or even a den


163
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:58.429
with seal pups.


164
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:06.769
It's a rare sight but Dale has observed
polar bears hunting, like these there


165
00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:16.249
is a hole here that barrel, which is
like that. If the hole is here, he


166
00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:20.419
could smell it and he will close the hole
and then dig this side out where the


167
00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:27.019
seal is at and it will scoop the seal
out. It's one of the earliest instinctive


168
00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:34.519
behaviours for polar bear cubs. While
their mom rests, these cubs will practice


169
00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:40.849
what it takes to become the apex
predator of the Arctic. Learning to lead


170
00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:43.849
with your nose,


171
00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:55.529
investigate anything out of the ordinary,
leap across unstable chunks of ice and


172
00:21:55.530 --> 00:22:03.149
of course the belly flop. But when Mom
huffs, the cubs know it's time to


173
00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:06.149
continue with the real hunt.


174
00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:18.609
Polar bear tracks have led us here


175
00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:24.428
A whaling camp perched at the edge of a
lead. A bear was spotted just a day ago,


176
00:22:24.429 --> 00:22:27.428
perhaps the very one we're looking for.


177
00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:34.999
For the Inupia, well-hunting is an ancient
way of life that continues nearly


178
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.999
unchanged today.


179
00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:46.989
With 24 hours of light the rhythm of
life is set by the whales,


180
00:22:48.970 --> 00:23:08.168
not the Sun. Whale hunting is by far
the most dangerous part of their


181
00:23:08.169 --> 00:23:12.189
subsistence life and these young people
are doing it just the way that their


182
00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:20.259
ancestors did. These guys are like 20, 22
years old and have each got a role and


183
00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:27.189
it’s importance to the community is vital.
We are when you become a captain and


184
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:31.479
it's your first whale and you give the whole
thing away to all the whaling cruise. You


185
00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:37.119
just learned over time that what you
catch isn't really yours as a hunter


195
00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:42.339
you're here to feed the town and
the families, not really for yourself.


196
00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:47.979
Ihe new PS commitment to this tradition
is help to keep this part of the


197
00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:54.038
coastline free of oil development.
Without their protection, this vital


198
00:23:54.039 --> 00:23:57.339
habitat may disappear completely.


199
00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:01.329
Whale off in the background blow hole there.


200
00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.899
Wow


201
00:24:06.429 --> 00:24:14.349
Maybe our wait is over as the whale
approaches, the camp becomes dead silent


202
00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:30.698
As soon as the whale surfaces, the boat
is launched.


203
00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:39.248
It's a tense moment as the men paddle
towards the massive whale, somewhere just


204
00:24:39.249 --> 00:24:46.569
under the surface. Harpooning a whale by
hand is extremely dangerous,


205
00:24:47.919 --> 00:24:52.928
bowhead whales can weigh 60 tons. One
swipe of its enormous tail fluke could


206
00:24:52.929 --> 00:24:55.928
easily crush the tiny craft.


207
00:25:01.639 --> 00:25:15.737
Because incredible system we were there trying
to get the whale out of the water. We dug two


208
00:25:15.739 --> 00:25:19.548
holes through the ice that go right through
and they're gonna see the block and


209
00:25:19.549 --> 00:25:22.548
tackle and they’ll be a able to hold the whale in.


210
00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:10.999
This bowhead whale will feed several
families throughout the season and


211
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.649
perhaps the polar bears as well. It’s a
cycle of life that has remained


212
00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:22.339
unchanged for thousands of years. Other
whales will continue their annual


213
00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:28.579
migration, following the open leads east
to their summer grounds in the Beaufort


214
00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:35.178
Sea. But the ice is too thin for us to go
any further.


215
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:44.659
It's late May and the pack ice is slowly
retreating. Right now,


216
00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.079
it certainly feels treacherous out here,
doesn't it?


217
00:26:52.279 --> 00:26:58.908
There are no shortcuts in the Arctic, you
have to know when to call it quits. As


218
00:26:58.909 --> 00:27:01.939
Dale often says if you don't come back
this season,


219
00:27:02.539 --> 00:27:05.538
you can't hunt next season.


220
00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:11.869
It's a good lesson even for a polar bear.


221
00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:32.798
But continually having to hold himself
onto the ice takes an immense amount of


222
00:27:32.799 --> 00:27:41.829
energy, polar bears face this challenge
every spring for the impacts of a


223
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:44.829
warming world have made matters worse.


224
00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:54.539
Lots of pack ice is estimated eleven
percent per decade.


225
00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:08.239
The bears’ fragile hunting platform is
getting thinner and this mother and


226
00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:11.558
cub found themselves


227
00:28:11.559 --> 00:28:15.219
in an ocean of melting ice.


228
00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:24.198
And if warming trends continue, seems
like this will become common.


229
00:28:35.929 --> 00:28:42.048
Like many animals that have made such
great leaps in their evolution to


230
00:28:42.049 --> 00:28:46.638
survive, the world may be changing too
fast for polar bears to keep up with.


231
00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:57.418
While the endless Arctic Sun slowly
erodes the ice, it brings renewed life to


232
00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:00.399
the tundra


233
00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.729
and the season of the Grizzly has only
just begun.


224
00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:14.019
It's the perfect time to head South and
into the heart of the Brooks Range. There’s like


225
00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:23.289
a perfect valley for grizzly bears. Well,leave it and 
find it now, okay? We pick this spot was a grizzly.
We're following the caribou trails of


226
00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:30.069
great migrations from seasons past.
It’s absolutely cover with caribou trails right up


227
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:35.408
the mountains, right over the ridges, one valley
to the next and we're hoping


228
00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:40.359
these caribou tracks will point the way
to Arctic Grizzlies. It may be our best


229
00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:47.829
chance at a closer look at this elusive
predator. But finding nearly


230
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:52.719
half-a-million caribou in the vastness
of the Western Arctic takes patience and


231
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:58.599
persistence. We picked this spot because it
caribou trails all around down either


232
00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.658
valley, each side of the tent here.


233
00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:06.339
No single caribou yet and not a single
bear but hopefully when the caribou


234
00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:10.299
arrived which they could in big numbers
and the bear may arrive as well. That's


235
00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.679
that's what we're hoping for.


236
00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:16.299
We've enlisted the aid of aerial
cameraman Daniel’s apps to help document


237
00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:21.639
the herd and hopefully the bears if we
find them. So based on what Jim from


238
00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:26.559
fishing games said, he said that the
females and calves are running along


239
00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:31.749
this line here to the North. Ok. And this
is also where he expects will see the


240
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:34.299
bears, but it's really unpredictable.


241
00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:38.918
It's completely unpredictable. Caribou
you never know where they're gonna go.


242
00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:51.168
Caribou are the ultimate wanderers.
Within a single year, the Western Arctic


243
00:30:51.169 --> 00:30:56.869
Herd will range across a quarter of
Alaska, an area the size of Montana.


244
00:30:56.870 --> 00:31:19.249
Oh, right there. Right there, huge herd of caribous 
all by the river. Wow, there must be at least a hundred
maybe a hundred fifty there. Oh, how fast you count.
Okay. Oh, that’s a good sign. Our first caribou.


245
00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:27.378
It looks like we're in luck, we've just
caught the tail end of a massive herd.


246
00:31:27.379 --> 00:31:43.069
Wow we have just settled down in a spot
here, so we're trying to stay very quiet,


247
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:48.319
reduce our silhouette on the horizon
because they're just so ever vigilant you


248
00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.768
know for wolves and grizzly bears that's
where the safety in number comes from.


249
00:31:51.769 --> 00:31:55.548
If you're eating, you're not watching.
You're watching, you're not eating.


250
00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:58.079
So if you're in a group, you can do both.


251
00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:08.219
Spring is carving season and some of
these newborns are just a few days old.


252
00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:13.898
Caribou calves can run within hours of
being born.


253
00:32:14.559 --> 00:32:17.558
It's a matter of survival.


254
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:42.009
Newly born calves are most vulnerable to
predators and they have to stay close to


255
00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:45.009
mom at all times.


256
00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:51.609
Wolves are never far behind


257
00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:02.169
This grey wolf is testing the herd,


258
00:33:03.559 --> 00:33:06.558
looking for any signs of weakness.


259
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.499
He's joined by another from the pack,


260
00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:29.059
together they've cut the herd in half.


261
00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:45.749
but soon the herd has regrouped and the
wolves give up the chase.


262
00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:55.939
There's little rest for the herd until
they complete their seasonal migration


263
00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:58.939
to their summer range.


264
00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:06.918
Caribou are largely sustained by the
high-energy sugars found in Arctic


265
00:34:06.919 --> 00:34:13.188
lichen. So priced is this plant that many
biologists believe the availability of


266
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:18.228
lichen during the winter months can
profoundly impact caribou numbers.


267
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:32.029
Well the caribou, this landscape wouldn't
look the way it does they aerate the


268
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:37.668
soil as they're walking to make it more
productive for plants, even their hair


269
00:34:37.668 --> 00:34:42.288
provides nesting material for migratory
birds around here and you can imagine


270
00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:49.067
how much fertiliser half-a-million
caribou create, like blood vessels


271
00:34:49.069 --> 00:34:52.067
flowing across this giant landscape.


272
00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:05.739
Wow, look at that, the mom with three cubs.


273
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:15.989
These are spring cubs in their first
year of life foraging along the hillside.


274
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:22.617
Arctic Grizzlies must make the most of
these short summers and that includes


275
00:35:22.619 --> 00:35:31.469
this mating pair that have somehow found each
other in this vast expanse. Grizzlies


276
00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:38.249
must cover great distances just to find
enough food. At Arctic Grizzly, an open


277
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:46.948
tundra can have a home range the size of
Yellowstone. Once you touch down, keeping


278
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:49.948
up with the Grizzly is nearly impossible.


279
00:36:01.329 --> 00:36:10.689
For the caribou, their journey is nearly
over. The herd has finally made it to


280
00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:16.957
their summer range, the completion of
their journey. But caribou are wanderers


281
00:36:16.959 --> 00:36:19.957
and they don't stay put for long.


282
00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:33.279
With the herd moving on and only
fleeting glimpses of grizzlies, we are


283
00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:36.279
left with few choices.


284
00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:41.348
An old report of a salmon run has given
us some hope.


285
00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:52.488
Well, I mean I think this is far inland. It looks
like a good one, don’t you? But this far inland, it's a


286
00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:58.548
long shot, even if we find salmon in the
river.


287
00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:03.469
No one I’ve spoken with is actually seen
Arctic Grizzlies fishing.


288
00:37:15.279 --> 00:37:24.158
The caribou torned me but it's not them
I’m looking for. Finding bear signs is the


289
00:37:24.159 --> 00:37:27.158
priority here.


290
00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:34.468
But if grizzlies are around, it’s best to
be prepared.


291
00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:40.578
I carry a shotgun only as an extreme
precaution.


292
00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:47.358
And believe it or not, they're really
popular thing with cranky bear is this


293
00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:52.249
Hedysarum root. They love this stuff.
I'm surprised this morsel has been left actually.


294
00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:55.428
You might look at this place and 
think it doesn't offer


295
00:37:55.430 --> 00:38:00.318
very much but they piece together a diet.
Little bit by little bit they get by


296
00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:11.808
here. The tracks all through here. Look at
this fresh grizzly bear tracks and then


297
00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:13.069
right in front of it


298
00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:18.889
caribou track. So both of these species
are using this river to get from A to B


299
00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:23.538
and occasionally if a bear is lucky, they will
have to prey on a caribou especially


300
00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:26.538
during the carving season.


301
00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:43.408
Wow look at that, the salmon are running.
The question is where are the bears.


302
00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:50.729
Really time for a cup of coffee I think.


303
00:38:55.830 --> 00:39:00.149
After hours of waiting, there's a shadow
moving through the willows.


304
00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:09.888
oh yeah, that’s right.




305
00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:22.888
There's a third cub coming up the river. Okay,
I see here.


306
00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:35.848
She's crossing here, I do not want to
surprise this bear though. Artic


307
00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:40.798
Grizzlies have a much more aggressive
reputation than coastal brown bears. She


308
00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.209
seems pretty cool.


309
00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:47.578
She seen us. Just finding one would be
chance enough. How far back as the third


310
00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:50.308
one, right behind the second. Okay.


311
00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:57.058
The fourth one is way back there in the
willows on this side of the creek. But


312
00:39:57.060 --> 00:40:00.058
now, we suddenly surrounded by four.


313
00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:39.808
The family seems to be using the river
as a corridor but their food is buried


314
00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:42.808
in the tundra.


315
00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:56.238
Hedysarum roots are an important source
of protein for Arctic Grizzlies. The


316
00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:01.848
bears lack of interest and the salmon is
possling but these chum salmon don't


317
00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:06.979
have nearly the fat and calories as
those the bears eat along the coast. Once


318
00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:12.709
they leave the saltwater to head
upstream, they stop eating. All their


319
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:18.919
energy goes into reaching the spawning
ground where they were born. For these


320
00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:26.118
fish that's roughly 400 river miles.
after weeks of swimming upstream, they've


321
00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:30.408
used a tremendous amount of their
reserves to get here and the ones


322
00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:36.318
vibrant colour has faded from their skin.
Males will gather and fight for position


323
00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:39.319
as females arrive.


324
00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:46.679
Once this courting process starts, it can
take hours or even days to complete.


325
00:41:51.099 --> 00:42:00.098
The family has returned but this time
they've staked out a spot on the river.


326
00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:05.459
Mom is completely focused on fishing.



327
00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:27.828
She's landed a huge chum salmon.


328
00:42:35.069 --> 00:42:39.658
The whole family retreats into the
willows to share the fish. Here in the


329
00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:48.267
Arctic a catch like this is quite a
bounty. Mom quickly returns to the


330
00:42:48.269 --> 00:42:58.317
river's edge. The cubs will pick this
fish clean while mom looks for more.


331
00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:04.959
Look at those cubs, all lined up waiting for
mom to catch dinner.


332
00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:44.479
She's quickly proving to be a skilled
fisher and by the looks of these cubs,


333
00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:48.709
she's been an excellent provider for the
first two and a half years of their


334
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:49.729
lives.


335
00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:54.049
It's hard, it's hard to even imagine that was
cubs. They're almost as big as she is at


336
00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:55.369
this state.


337
00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:59.988
The Cubs have been watching her closely
and now instead of feasting off what


338
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:04.308
she's caught, they seem to be interested
in learning to fish themselves.


339
00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:17.968
These new experiences show off how
different each of these cubs are. They’re


340
00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:25.348
all individuals. This cub has plenty of
confidence.


341
00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:36.929
His borderline troublesome. Close enough,
that’s close enough.



342
00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:39.298
It’s okay it’s alright. Seem good.


343
00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:43.349
It's alright. he ventures much further
than the other two and seems to be quite


344
00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:54.388
bold. This boldness concerns his mom
quite a bit, but it's also what yields


345
00:44:54.390 --> 00:45:00.298
him his first catch. Very nice. That's
great. They're learning, they got it. Ya.


346
00:45:05.119 --> 00:45:10.788
When he catches something, it's his alone.
He is already showing his independence.


347
00:45:15.350 --> 00:45:21.078
The other two cubs are more plush and
cub like than their brother. One is


348
00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:28.519
playful and anxious as he bounds into the
water after fish. The other cub is much


349
00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:31.519
more cautious, sticking close to mom.


350
00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:48.229
For the first time in the days we've
been watching her, she's able to rest


351
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:57.587
comfortably on the shore while the cubs
patrol the shallow river. It's doubtful


352
00:45:57.589 --> 00:46:00.587
they know this is their last summer
under her care and guidance.


353
00:46:10.619 --> 00:46:20.189
At last her smallest cub is beginning to
focus on the salmon. Mom follows close


354
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:23.189
behind stirring up the fish.


355
00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:40.759
She gives up the chase, letting her cub
finish the catch. Oh look at that. It’s


356
00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:44.659
not uncommon to see a mother get very
protective and aggressive while fishing.


357
00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:51.769
To me, she seems intent on preparing
these cubs for life on their own as she


358
00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:53.538
does with finding food.


359
00:46:53.540 --> 00:47:04.278
Don't forget we're here. After several
days of being watched, her curiosity for


360
00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:10.399
us has finally peaked. Hey bear, you are a
good mama, ah you are so sweet.


361
00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:16.909
Ah look at her back up like that. But
we're gonna get out of your way.


362
00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:24.249
And that's our cue.


363
00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:32.119
We'll take a cue from this. A good lesson
for us to keep in mind is to always


364
00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:35.118
leave on a good note.


365
00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:41.959
While it may be some time before they
come across people again when they do, we


366
00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:44.959
want their memory of us to be a positive
one.


367
00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:59.909
With a few short huffs, she rounds up
her family to call it a day.


368
00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:09.879
We really didn't know we entered this
situation if she was going to be


369
00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.949
accepting of us or not


370
00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:19.898
and she's emerged to be this wise, mature,
thoughtful, careful female. It's taken us


371
00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:23.649
time to get to know them and to
understand that, so we know what their


372
00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:29.169
limits are and it reminds you that any
two bears are as different as any two


373
00:48:29.170 --> 00:48:32.169
people you might encounter.


374
00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:41.628
And over this journey, it's become clear.
The world these bears inhabit is vast.


375
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:46.639
That it must remains so to sustain such
great wondrous.


376
00:48:50.330 --> 00:48:57.229
The resources we so priced are embedded
in the land that sustains all life here.


377
00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:03.459
Like the great plains of Africa,


378
00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:10.398
Alaska is the last stronghold for some
of the Earth's wildest creatures.


379
00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:19.658
I've never felt so comfortable or so
alive as i do here.


380
00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:26.319
This may be the end of my journey, but
Alaska's wilderness and its wildest


381
00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:28.109
creatures


382
00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:31.109
will always call me back.


383
00:50:08.869 --> 00:50:14.118
