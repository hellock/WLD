1
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.109
What our loot of one is acquired temple


2
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.399
set in the remote countryside of


3
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.439
northern Thailand. The nine monks who


4
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.229
live here belong to a strict buddhist


5
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:52.229
sect, dedicated to a life of simplicity


6
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:54.629
and purity.


7
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.519
They live at peace with the world hidden


8
00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:00.659
away and the natural wilderness of


9
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:09.539
Thailand's last woodlands.


10
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:14.999
But this is a monastery like no other. I


11
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:34.739
was born in the tiger year 1951, the


12
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:37.589
Chinese year is tiger year.


13
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:43.109
The forest monk at this ministry share


14
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.999
their lives with 11 tigers.


15
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.649
Every day, these self-trained keepers


16
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:56.568
devote their lives to looking after


17
00:01:46.650 --> 00:02:09.239
these huge animals.


18
00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:13.409
It is a unique site,


19
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:16.529
the monks control their tigers with


20
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:29.289
gentle coaxing, mutual trust and a lot of


21
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:32.018
respect.


22
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:45.847
The monks love their tigers, the tigers


23
00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:47.619
love the monks. The abbot shampoo sit


24
00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.958
strolls around his ministry with the


25
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.869
calm serenity of a man totally at peace


26
00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.969
with himself. He has been in charge of


27
00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:14.559
the monastery from the beginning long


28
00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:21.638
before the first tigers arrived.


29
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:24.589
25 years ago, Shampoo Sit was diagnosed


30
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:28.789
with leukemia,


31
00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:32.299
he had two years before the cancer would


32
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:35.958
take his life, he decided to devote


33
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:39.439
himself to buddhist meditation, and now


34
00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.268
the cancer has gone into remission. His


35
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.448
second chance has given him a zest for


36
00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:54.818
life and more importantly a love for all


37
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:57.698
living things.


38
00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:06.218
This is my monastery, I have


39
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:09.728
11 tigers. All of animals here,


40
00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:12.637
they come by themselves. And I


41
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:17.379
rescue them, and protect them and feed


42
00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:23.379
them. The first thing that I have is a


43
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:28.418
chicken and peacock, deer, horse, cow, buffalo,


44
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:33.038
barking deer, reindeer, and some of the


45
00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:35.439
mountain goats. There is even a leopard


46
00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:38.079
which arrived one day injured as a


47
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:43.239
cub, now to use to humans,


48
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:44.619
it cannot be released. But it is the


49
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.089
bigger cats that are still the most


50
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:52.749
distinguished guests. Are you meaning


51
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.728
storm and safer meaning Thunder? With the


52
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.909
first to tiger cubs to arrive at the


53
00:04:54.729 --> 00:05:00.219
monastery, now full-grown these two


54
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.779
refugees and the forests can remember no


55
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.689
other life than this peaceful


56
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.819
coexistence with the abbot, but their


57
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:13.809
lives were not always this contented.


58
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:15.848
I got him from the Muslim people.


59
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:21.229
Karin Muslim people. They bring them from


60
00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:23.869
the border pass.


61
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:27.839
The border pass with Burma is a remote


62
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:31.709
and timeless wilderness.


63
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:35.009
Ethnic tribes people shy and elusive


64
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:37.709
Korean hill tribes, he can't in existence


65
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.869
living as they have done unchanged for


66
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:45.029
centuries.


67
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:47.579
Almost five years ago, a group of current


68
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:54.609
found young storm and thunder very near


69
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:56.079
death forest.


70
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.478
Their parents had been killed by poachers


71
00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.949
and the helpless cubs have been badly


72
00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:08.009
beaten and then left to die.


73
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:11.309
And the forest department police come to


74
00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:15.329
tell the Karin, you can bring the tiger and


75
00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:25.759
give it to me. And I'm very good


76
00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:31.819
you can ask me what you want.


77
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:38.239
And they want 2 sacks of rice


78
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:45.199
Okay, I give them. Now full grown, the elder

79
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:48.229
male Storm is the patriarch of this


80
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.269
group of rescue tigers. He has been the


81
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:54.529
key to the other streams of letting


82
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:56.569
his tiger population grow. Four months


83
00:06:54.530 --> 00:07:00.289
ago, the monastery reach the turning


84
00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:03.139
point, this very first tiger to arrive is


85
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:06.889
now a proud father of two cubs, one male


86
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:10.999
and one female. It was the answer to the


87
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:15.529
abbot streams. In our dreams, or in my


88
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.979
dreams, the sky, every people want to be


89
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:22.399
in the sky, or in stars or something like this.


90
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:24.409
It is very difficult for the human to get


91
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:28.039
the star, you know very diffcultbut. So that's


92
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:30.439
why he come to me. I just choose,


93
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:35.329
that one or that one, that one. Some of


94
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:38.179
the sky or star like this. The


95
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:41.329
added names of the tigers after the heavens as


96
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:43.759
he believes they are heaven-sent. He


97
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:47.179
named the young female Malika meaning


98
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:52.179
star and her twin brother em far meaning


99
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:56.799
flying into the sky.


100
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:59.499
The young female Malika is a


101
00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.719
curious, playful new edition. Her good


102
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:06.638
nature and boundless energy delight the


103
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:09.668
monks. Very naughty, because they


104
00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:12.668
move very fast. That one, the little one, they move very fast.


105
00:08:09.669 --> 00:08:15.309
 If we let them out


106
00:08:12.669 --> 00:08:27.969
we have to catch them in the cage first


107
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:30.279
Naughty tiger! As time went by, the


108
00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:32.379
Monastery group reputation and more


109
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:35.227
people brought in cubs whose parents had

110
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:37.538
been killed by poachers. The forest


111
00:08:35.229 --> 00:08:38.978
temple was unwittingly becoming a tiger


112
00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:40.989
orphanage.


113
00:08:38.979 --> 00:08:43.809
It was never designed to house unwanted


114
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:45.249
tigers but for the abbot the alternative


115
00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:49.028
is unthinkable.


116
00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:52.569
How can i take them back to the jungle?


117
00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:55.269
He can't stay in the jungle. When they


118
00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:59.769
hungry, they come to see the people, the


119
00:08:55.270 --> 00:09:03.639
people there shoot them. So if I take them back


120
00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:08.739
to the jungle, like I take them


121
00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:11.649
go to their deaths. a virgin pussy never asked for


122
00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:13.749
the tigers to come to him, but now they wait


123
00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:14.499
were here, he was not going to let them


124
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:17.289
down.


125
00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:19.149
This simple man was about to rewrite the


126
00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:22.899
rules of keeping large predators


127
00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:41.659
alongside humans. The destiny of a bird


128
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:44.899
Archon posted and his tigers was sealed.


129
00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:47.779
Just four months since she would have


130
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:50.809
fit into one hand the new cub, Dalika,


131
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:55.639
is growing up fast.


132
00:09:50.810 --> 00:10:02.598
She's already becoming a force of nature.


133
00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:07.489
She will soon be too big to enjoy a trip


134
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:09.979
out in the local area, but for now it's


135
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:16.129
stimulating treat, taking in the sights


136
00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:18.649
and sounds of her world. Dalika's world


137
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:22.039
is conscience of worried on the border


138
00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:24.079
between Thailand and Burma. Every year


139
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.419
thousands of tourists visit the river


140
00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.639
kwai bridge and pay respects to the


141
00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:31.039
fallen allied soldiers who were forced


142
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:35.809
to build this implmennce Japanese railway.


143
00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:37.879
Margarita Steinhardt is a Russian


144
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:40.129
scholar who was visiting the wartime


145
00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:44.869
shrines last year when she heard about


146
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:47.869
the forest temple. When the abbot invited


147
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:49.909
her to stay, she didn't hesitate. As an


148
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:52.399
ecologist, she found this the perfect


149
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:59.029
place to study tigers in close proximity


150
00:10:52.400 --> 00:11:00.829
For the first time, an outsider has been


151
00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:04.189
allowed to witness the relationships


152
00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:05.899
between the tigers on the monks. By the


153
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:08.179
fact that they grew up here from very


154
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:11.059
little age, all together with so much


155
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:12.889
human contact, their wild instincts


156
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:14.598
haven't been developed at all.


157
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:17.209
They totally undisturbed by as they


158
00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:19.609
don't us as potential prey or they are


159
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:23.509
threatened by us. Today, he is sitting


160
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:27.199
next to me, a tiger almost like a puppy


161
00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:28.939
dog. Sometimes the tigers here seem to


162
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:32.119
have forgotten that they are tigers at


163
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:33.979
all. The second of the hill tribe tigers


164
00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.439
has bonded with the abbot to such an


165
00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:38.829
extent. He is now the most spoiled tiger


166
00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:42.759
in the canyon.


167
00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:46.909
He still suckles the abbot's thumb,


168
00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:49.759
old habits die hard.


169
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:52.849
This large predator name Thunder, still


171
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:55.999
thinks he's a cub, even the small stones


172
00:11:52.850 --> 00:12:08.619
on the pathway causing the problem.


173
00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:12.429
This is one fussy attention seeker.


174
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:15.549
They grew up with people, most of them


175
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:17.529
came here just a few weeks old, and they are


176
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:19.689
hand raised by people, so they look at us


177
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:23.379
as, not all of us, the monks particularly


178
00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:29.979
as almost mother figures. He makes like he's


179
00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:32.619
friendly like this, he come to me, like he wants to say something.


180
00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:34.449
He want to say happy, or he wants to say hello or something


181
00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:36.939
something you want to


182
00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:40.359
say happy all we. Wants to


183
00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:49.599
speak with me like this, want to


184
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:52.989
speak. The abbot is like a proud


185
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:55.869
parent to his tigers. His favorite Storm,


186
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:57.669
one of the first two tigers to arrive, is


187
00:12:55.870 --> 00:13:00.519
not as gentle as his brother dainty


188
00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:02.529
brother. His crooked tail is testament to


189
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:04.029
his earlier brutal mistreatment at the


190
00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:07.479
hands of the poachers.


191
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:16.479
He's like a son to the abbot, all be it,


192
00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:20.169
an unruly teenager. The first tiger here


193
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:23.409
and that one. So now he thinks he's


194
00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:27.039
the boss. So he can control every


195
00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:29.259
tiger here, this one. The monks have


196
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:32.619
to be a certain kind of person to handle


197
00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:35.349
their oversized cats. Each of the abbot


198
00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:38.289
disciples are here for different reasons.


199
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:40.929
Monk Pu is the most enthusiastic of the


200
00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:43.059
monks. He has taken charge of the video


201
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:45.399
camera donated to the monastery by a


202
00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:48.009
wealthy follower, and is compiling a


203
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:54.489
unique video diary of the temple tigers.


204
00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:57.609
Getting this close to a full-grown tiger,


205
00:13:54.490 --> 00:14:00.009
is very dangerous but who will able to get


206
00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:03.399
closer than any other as, he's known many


207
00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:06.189
of the tigers since they were cubs. They


208
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:11.449
trust him and it returned pose happily


209
00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:19.099
for home movies of breathtaking intimacy.


210
00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:21.379
I love them a lot, especially these two new born cubs


211
00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:28.189
Hern Fa, and Dalika


212
00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:32.088
because I fed them with milk,


214
00:14:32.089 --> 00:14:40.128
bathed them and took care of them.



216
00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:49.669
There is one monk who knows no


217
00:14:48.649 --> 00:14:54.708
fear.


218
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:58.518
Monk June can handle all of the tigers


219
00:14:54.709 --> 00:15:03.468
without flinching, he can overcome their


220
00:14:58.519 --> 00:15:08.119
aggression and this fascinates him. As a monk


221
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:13.669
I like it because I have never seen


222
00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:19.308
a tiger. After I see them I want to be close to them.


223
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:23.028
To know what it will be like because the


224
00:15:19.309 --> 00:15:26.328
tiger is a fierce animal. It is a delicate


225
00:15:23.029 --> 00:15:28.159
balancing act, once a tiger intimidate


226
00:15:26.329 --> 00:15:30.257
some monk, people forever assume


227
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.239
dominance. You would not want to fill


228
00:15:30.259 --> 00:15:34.509
ground tiger to think it was above you


229
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:43.719
in their social pecking order.


230
00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:45.999
The monks enter this minefield with


231
00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:49.269
nothing in their armoury, accept a stick,


232
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.359
a bottle of water and a lot of nerve.


233
00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:55.689
A monk do have sticks and the tiger is


234
00:15:52.360 --> 00:16:00.009
actually conditioned to respond to erase


235
00:15:55.690 --> 00:16:03.669
hand with a stick in hand and water.


236
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:05.589
They do back out, every


237
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:07.209
time I've seen a tiger misbehave,


238
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:10.239
Monk will approach the tiger wood back


239
00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:12.459
off a hundred percent, but these are


240
00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:16.179
animals, they act on instincts,


241
00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:18.969
anything can happen really. Sometimes it


242
00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:21.669
turns into a battle of wills. Normally


243
00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:25.859
practice Storm is getting irritated in the


244
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:30.148
canyon.


245
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:31.619
Usually it's a simple matter of saving


246
00:16:30.149 --> 00:16:33.689
face,


247
00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:38.639
unfortunately for Storms neighbor


248
00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:43.049
someone had to take the hit.


249
00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:48.879
Yes I got bitten but it's not so hard.


250
00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:51.549
After bitting they just release.


251
00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:55.839
They are just teasing.


252
00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:58.899
You have to be with them a longer period


253
00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:02.229
If they are with you for only 2 or 3 days,


254
00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:05.019
they may really bite you. There's one guest here


255
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:07.179
who takes up the most manpower. He's a Bengal tiger


256
00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:11.499
and a big one at that.


257
00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:15.009
The abbot calls him Mac meaning cloud.


258
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:18.249
Almost two metres long and weighing in


259
00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:22.208
a 250 kilos, he dwarfs his smaller


260
00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:23.708
Indo-Chinese cousins, and he knows it. A


261
00:17:22.209 --> 00:17:26.679
little bit of trouble from character


262
00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:31.299
probably due to his size, he's dominating


263
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:35.319
the others tiger, I guess and he could be difficult


264
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:37.629
to control due to the strength he has. He


265
00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:39.819
arrived here when he was four or five


266
00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:41.949
months old so here still retain some of


267
00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:43.629
these wild instinct. He is not as tame as


268
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:47.829
the others.


269
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:51.669
I'll make he's biggest tiger


270
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:56.289
here. He's good and Maek is strong


271
00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:59.619
andhe scare all of the tigers.


273
00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:03.819
A fearless individual who cannot be


274
00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:06.129
intimidated.


275
00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:10.899
There is of course only one monk who can


276
00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:12.609
handle him. The monk here cried room, he


277
00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:14.649
seems to have the best relationship with


278
00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:18.698
Mac, some say they even have similar


279
00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:20.799
temperaments, similar personalities. He


280
00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:23.499
has recently started to form an intense


281
00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:26.499
rivalry with the other male tiger Storm.


282
00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:28.779
Even with the Phillies monk June to keep


283
00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:30.759
nor and order in the canyon, the abbot


284
00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:32.589
one more monks to be at the ready in


285
00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:49.879
case they fight each other for dominance.


286
00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:55.908
For now the mighty Mac must remain the cage.


287
00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:59.269
There is one tiger who is so popular,


288
00:18:55.910 --> 00:19:01.909
she is seldom in her cage. The playful


289
00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:05.569
cub young Dalika is now getting too big


290
00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:07.729
to chase piglets. Today she is the


291
00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:10.938
picture of health but she very nearly


292
00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:13.009
died. At birth,


293
00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:15.529
her mother rejected her and as a result


294
00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:18.559
of the constant handling of humans, are


295
00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:20.929
delicate hip became disticated. She


296
00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:30.079
was to prove that raising tiger is no


297
00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:34.549
easy thing. Dalika.


298
00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:37.039
The abbot went to Dr. Somechai


299
00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:40.219
Visasmonkolchai for advice on what to do


300
00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:42.529
with the first cub. He is in fact used to


301
00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:47.719
treating horses and cattle not sickly


302
00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:53.929
tiger cubs. He had to learn from scratch.


303
00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:55.339
Okay this is the first cups that was born in


304
00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:59.089
captivity here.


305
00:19:55.340 --> 00:20:02.029
So their mother not accept and


306
00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:06.319
we separate them from the mother and

307
00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:09.019
then take care of them. And at the first step


308
00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:12.739
she cannot eat, so we change the


309
00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:16.189
nutrition. Now se can eat about 5 kilograms


310
00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:29.699
per day so it's quite good, a little bit


311
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:32.249
fatter.


312
00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:38.398
With the right nutritional, the cubs are


313
00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:40.469
now growing stronger and cheekier. But it's


314
00:20:38.399 --> 00:20:42.749
all trial and error, there are no


315
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:45.388
presidence for looking after wild tigers


316
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:48.359
in a  Buddhist monastery. They seem to be


317
00:20:45.389 --> 00:20:50.819
doing everything quite perfectly. There is


318
00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.629
nothing that stands out to be wrong with


319
00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:55.079
the place.


320
00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:56.879
I've observed for myself how the cubs


321
00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.678
grow up, how they develop at what age,


322
00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:01.199
which things  happen to them.


323
00:20:58.679 --> 00:21:03.028
I’ve looked into their behaviour but I have


324
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:06.209
a lot of data which I haven't


325
00:21:03.029 --> 00:21:08.249
analysed yet and I will have to do a


326
00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:09.928
comparative study with  zoo tigers and


327
00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:17.009
I’ll see the differences in behavior.


328
00:21:09.929 --> 00:21:19.259
Through the experience of Dalica, the


329
00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:22.558
monks now know much more about raising


330
00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:29.939
tiger cubs. It's a good thing.


331
00:21:22.559 --> 00:21:32.819
Six days ago two more cubs were born.


332
00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:34.648
The  monastery is now full. For the


333
00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:36.089
moment, these are the last cubs that can


334
00:21:34.649 --> 00:21:43.408
be born here.


335
00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:46.168
This makes them very special indeed. The


336
00:21:43.409 --> 00:21:49.378
adult has named the growing cubs Fa Mai


337
00:21:46.169 --> 00:21:54.538
meaning new day and Fa Rong meaning


338
00:21:49.379 --> 00:21:56.758
sunshine. As the weeks pass, mongpus


339
00:21:54.539 --> 00:22:04.749
video diary records the progress of the


340
00:21:56.759 --> 00:22:07.419
new cubs.


341
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:10.299
I didn't have get married yet. I didn't have


342
00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:12.369
because  I am a pico. But your wife


343
00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:14.408
have  pregnant something like that.


344
00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:17.109
Yeah, in the area I feel happy like this.


345
00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:24.249
So, I feel like that

346
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:26.799
like all baby come here and come to me. As


347
00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:28.749
his family of predators grows, the adult


348
00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:30.549
knows that he cannot continue his work


349
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:32.709
with the tigers unless the


350
00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:35.769
infrastructure of the  monastery changes.


351
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:40.589
He is hatching a remarkable and


352
00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:43.439
ambitious plan.


353
00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:45.629
To create more space  for his charges, Kanchanaburi


354
00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:48.119
has planned to convert 20


355
00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:50.489
acres of land behind the cages  into a


356
00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:52.468
natural  forest playground for his tigers.


357
00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:54.349
Come here, here.


358
00:22:54.350 --> 00:23:03.859
From here, we plan the new house for them. If


359
00:23:01.309 --> 00:23:08.029
the  tiger is one, the next generation, the next generation


360
00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:12.198
and the next generation. The  project are


361
00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:24.288
planning to take them back to the jungle.


362
00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:26.509
that's all of my dream. Many would think of it


363
00:23:24.289 --> 00:23:31.639
as an impossible dream for a handful of


364
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:33.979
monks living in a remote  forest. But our


365
00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:37.158
champusit does not know the meaning of


366
00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:39.469
impossible.


367
00:23:37.159 --> 00:23:41.388
His determination and spirit has


368
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:44.719
attracted followers from all walks of


369
00:23:41.389 --> 00:24:12.049
life, teachers, lawyers and rather


370
00:23:44.720 --> 00:24:16.219
usefully a local Thai army general.


371
00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:18.679
These Thai soldiers are used to taking


372
00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:24.729
orders  but today their orders will not


373
00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:27.159
come from any army officer.


374
00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:29.829
The forest land will be clear to form a


375
00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:33.428
trench six meters deep and eight meters


376
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:35.558
wide.


377
00:24:33.429 --> 00:24:37.719
This will be the safety boat encircling


378
00:24:35.559 --> 00:24:51.109
a central area behind the existing


379
00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:54.859
gauges forming a tiger island.


380
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:57.048
There is much work ahead but achampus


381
00:24:54.860 --> 00:25:02.869
dream is starting to become a


382
00:24:57.049 --> 00:25:04.789
reality. For the  monks, it's a rare


383
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:08.928
opportunity to escape the confines of


384
00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:10.999
the  monastery and head out. They want to


385
00:25:08.929 --> 00:25:15.769
take a look at a tiger breeding reserve


386
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:17.899
70 kilometers to the North. Aaway from the


387
00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:19.609
watchful eyes of the  Abbott, who is to


388
00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:21.949
know if they're single rice meal of the


389
00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:34.458
day is supplemented by something  little


390
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:36.529
tastier. This sanctuary has been set up


391
00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:39.649
by the Thai government for homeless and


392
00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:42.168
confiscated tigers. They are deliberately


393
00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:54.048
left alone with minimal human contact.


394
00:25:42.169 --> 00:25:57.859
 magic part 104 another copy number    not


395
00:25:54.049 --> 00:26:00.829
 done yet


396
00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:01.849
 Danielle    and    I have another    landing    how


397
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:06.469
 I    will die


398
00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:08.779
These aren't the tim  tigers of the


399
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:14.178
monastery but they still recognize the


400
00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:18.378
monks tiger calls.


401
00:26:14.179 --> 00:26:31.008
The tiger island will feature a similar


402
00:26:18.379 --> 00:26:40.008
compound surrounded by a fence. Back for


403
00:26:31.009 --> 00:26:42.648
 another    great. Satisfaction all-round.


404
00:26:40.009 --> 00:26:45.678
Soon monk June will see his tigers


405
00:26:42.649 --> 00:26:47.448
roaming as free as the ones here,  but


406
00:26:45.679 --> 00:26:52.998
their exuberance  is going to be


407
00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:55.368
 short-lived. Back home    a dark cloud hangs


408
00:26:52.999 --> 00:27:12.178
over the  monastery, one of the abbot's


409
00:26:55.369 --> 00:27:16.979
cubs has died.


410
00:27:12.179 --> 00:27:19.829
The  monastery is having a black day. The


411
00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:26.849
digging had stopped and the soldiers have


412
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:29.339
returned to bar rest.  Beneath the soft


413
00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:31.258
red earth,  detractors    have    hit    hard


414
00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:34.378
bedrock that will have to be cleared


415
00:27:31.259 --> 00:27:35.428
before  doing can continue but the money


416
00:27:34.379 --> 00:27:42.239
has run out.


417
00:27:35.429 --> 00:27:45.298
It's a huge disappointment. Half of the


418
00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:48.118
way is very difficult  work to do,


419
00:27:45.299 --> 00:27:50.908
because when we dig, we have a


420
00:27:48.119 --> 00:27:51.928
problem  with the stone like this.


421
00:27:51.929 --> 00:27:58.439
We have to dig 8m length and deep about 6m.


422
00:27:56.070 --> 00:28:02.038
And in 6m, we have a lot of rock


423
00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:07.739
like this. So very difficult, half way


424
00:28:02.039 --> 00:28:08.998
to do now. We we need about 10 10


425
00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:13.439
million Baht.


426
00:28:08.999 --> 00:28:15.329
I think should be enough for digging. If


427
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:18.239
the digging is not completed before the


428
00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:22.438
rainy season,  the sides will collapse and


429
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:25.288
the land will return to  forest. it's bad


430
00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:30.898
news that the monastery has much worse to


431
00:28:25.289 --> 00:28:33.418
follow. Both of the new cubs contracted


432
00:28:30.899 --> 00:28:41.928
bronchitis,  the weaker of the twins


433
00:28:33.419 --> 00:28:45.469
Sunshine has died.


434
00:28:41.929 --> 00:28:48.378
Her brother  Newday has managed to scrape


435
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:49.849
through,  but the abbot is extremely


436
00:28:48.379 --> 00:28:55.968
worried that he might suffer a relapse.


437
00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:57.948
Much to his frustration, he now has to


438
00:28:55.970 --> 00:29:06.689
endure a frequent checkups at the vets


439
00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:11.849
 clinic in the village.


440
00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:14.669
Ihe infection is bacteria acute


441
00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:18.989
infection, is very, very rapid and very


442
00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:23.039
fast. So it has high temperature, cannot


443
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:28.469
eat, cannot drink and no sound and this


444
00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:36.479
is the serious case and he says there


445
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:39.059
was die and Fa Mai is good luck. At his


446
00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:42.509
evening retreat,  the abbot meditates with


447
00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:47.279
a heavy heart. The loss of young Sunshine


448
00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:49.739
is devastating, but Kanchanaburi sits


449
00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:51.689
world is within the bigger picture of


450
00:29:49.740 --> 00:30:00.479
life and existence.


451
00:29:51.690 --> 00:30:03.479
The Abbot is a Buddhism monk, basically he


452
00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:06.359
believes in reincarnation.  He told a lot


453
00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:09.029
that  not just only the tigers in the


454
00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:13.019
forest temple, but all the wild animals


455
00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:18.089
in the  forest temple is used to be the


456
00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:20.459
monks, used to be their family, used to be


457
00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:22.979
their friend.


458
00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:26.429
We dig the hole and put them in the


459
00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:28.619
ground before they leave. Okay,
so if you want to


460
00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:52.869
come back, please come back and stay with


461
00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:56.948
me.


462
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:59.438
On their daily ride into town to beg


463
00:30:56.950 --> 00:31:03.579
for Bahts, the mood in the truck is somber.


464
00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:07.119
The monks just lost a much-loved tiger


465
00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:13.299
cub and the tiger Island project is in


466
00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:15.819
jeopardy. But life goes on, the monks do


467
00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:18.549
not deal with money and so cannot buy


468
00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:20.499
themselves any food, they have to accept


469
00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:46.359
whatever the local people can spare for


470
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:48.969
them. The needs of the monks and the


471
00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:54.579
needs of the tigers run in tenden with


472
00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:57.699
the forest temple. A monastic life means


473
00:31:54.580 --> 00:32:00.698
a monastic diet eating red meat would go


474
00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:09.809
against Buddhist belief, so how contend


475
00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:14.729
meat-eating tigers live a Buddhist life?


476
00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:17.009
Each morning, the monks walk to the


477
00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:21.479
village to receive vegetarian food  and


478
00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:23.699
rice from the locals. The tigers are fed


479
00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:29.069
with chicken bones carefully minced to


480
00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:34.289
take away the appearance of meat. Then,


481
00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:36.359
dog biscuits are added. Everything is


482
00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:39.809
cooked and monks make sure that there


483
00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:43.168
are no traces or any hints of blood.


484
00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:45.209
The  tigers are not quite vegetarians as


485
00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:47.909
the monks are but they do not see this


486
00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:52.379
food  as the meat of another living being.


487
00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:55.739
It is a Buddhist principle but it seems


488
00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:57.179
to also be good science. If tigers would


489
00:32:55.740 --> 00:33:00.419
taste blood,


490
00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:02.129
it might or might not awaken their wild


491
00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:03.929
instincts. But then if a person  plays


492
00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:05.879
with the  tiger and gets bitten or cut


493
00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:09.539
and then the tiger tastes blood. It will


494
00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:17.519
straightaway associated with food.


495
00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:20.279
Both tigers and monks eat only


496
00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:24.989
one meal a day, it is an occasion to be


497
00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:27.179
savoured. Dalica and her brother are the


498
00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:29.099
privileged ones, sitting at the  monks


499
00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:34.259
table  .


500
00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:38.369
life is a monk is a precarious existence,


501
00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:40.979
they live on donated meals, donated land


502
00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:43.708
dressed in donated robes and feed the


503
00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:45.749
tigers with donated food.


504
00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:51.509
It all comes from  the local community.


505
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:56.499
Leftovers are given to the other animals,


506
00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:59.319
it's all about giving.


507
00:33:56.500 --> 00:34:01.779
It's customary for the local people to


508
00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:04.149
buy an animal like a chicken or even a


509
00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:07.569
 buffalo from a slaughterhouse to then


510
00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:09.969
set it free at a temple. In doing so, they


511
00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:27.038
have saved  a life which they believe


512
00:34:09.969 --> 00:34:30.488
helps them in the next reincarnation.


513
00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:34.118
Today, the  monastery is about to get a


514
00:34:30.489 --> 00:34:36.278
new  addition. The village heads


515
00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:37.988
grandchildren have found a baby deer


516
00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:42.069
while they were playing in the forest


517
00:34:37.989 --> 00:34:47.758
The tiny mouse deer is lost after being


518
00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:50.339
abandoned by its mother.


519
00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:51.779
The excited young followers insist on


520
00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:58.529
presenting it to the averred earthling.


521
00:34:51.780 --> 00:35:00.569
Recently, the abbot lost a life. Now a new


522
00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:03.209
tiny life has found its way to the


523
00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:06.569
forest temple. A gift from the local


524
00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:20.698
people,  the circle of life and death is


525
00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:24.369
complete.


526
00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:28.688
The  tigers are in town.


527
00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:31.088
To the local people,


528
00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:35.558
Dalica a new day are a welcome sight on


529
00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:37.389
their weekly food trip  at the town.


530
00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:39.819
These local  villagers give their full


531
00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:41.649
support to the abbot, happy to see his


532
00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:43.538
tigers whenever they came


533
00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:45.399
and by their presence in the local


534
00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:53.229
community, the tigers are giving


535
00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:55.749
something back. Riding  on the tiger


536
00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:58.689
temple reputation, a foundation has been


537
00:35:55.750 --> 00:36:02.919
 setup, staffed by volunteers to help the


538
00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:05.049
 poor communities in the area. The


539
00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:07.089
monastery grounds are now home to a small


540
00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:09.129
radio station which reaches out


541
00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:11.288
educating the people on the wrongs of


542
00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:12.848
poaching  as well as the abbot buddhist


543
00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:16.788
teachings of kindness and compassion.


544
00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:18.979
 indoor techies subsidies


545
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:21.468
 the   museum. It has created a loyal


546
00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:23.868
following of supporters to a keen to see


547
00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:27.048
his plans for a tiger  island become a


548
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:30.588
reality. The villagers seem to


549
00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:34.669
understand how important the  wild


550
00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:38.149
 animals to daily lives and they stopped


551
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:40.969
hurting  the animals. It means we


552
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:44.598
concern a big group of animal lover.


553
00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:48.618
The big group of animal lover is more


554
00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:52.609
valuable for conservation  because if we


555
00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:57.468
realise that we  had one kinds of


556
00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:59.929
living thing the same as the tiger. So


557
00:36:57.470 --> 00:37:32.568
the tiger has the right to stay on


558
00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:34.788
this earth like ours.


559
00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:36.979
The Katin, one of the biggest


560
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:41.337
fundraising  festivals in Thai Buddhism.


561
00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:43.948
The Health Ministry comes to life


562
00:37:41.339 --> 00:37:48.448
as usual the tiger cubs Newday and


563
00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:51.448
Dalica about of the festivities.


564
00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:53.607
This year the abbot loyal supporters


565
00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:55.168
have arrived in huge numbers to give the


566
00:37:53.609 --> 00:37:59.638
monastery the begging it desperately


567
00:37:55.170 --> 00:38:02.939
needs. Right now, the tiger project needs


568
00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:07.738
money.


569
00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:09.509
The local people don't disappoint.


570
00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:12.688
It looks like as the Tigers are to get


571
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:19.139
their  forest playground after all.


572
00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:21.209
There is one  tiger who will particularly


573
00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:24.749
relish the chance to roam the tiger


574
00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:27.959
island. Mac, the huge Bengal tiger is


575
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:30.058
still cooling off behind bars. If it


576
00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:31.678
wasn't for his hot temper  he would be


577
00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:34.317
going out into the canyon with the


578
00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:35.398
others.  With many monks busy with the


579
00:38:34.319 --> 00:38:36.868
festivities,


580
00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:40.169
there aren't  enough people to control


581
00:38:36.869 --> 00:38:44.669
him. His rival, Storm is not a


582
00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:45.929
particularly brave tiger. If he runs at


583
00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:47.788
the  site of water,


584
00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:52.138
he doesn't stand much chance against the


585
00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:56.008
much stronger force of nature.


586
00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:58.979
Maek, maek  to be everyday if we have the pico is enough


587
00:38:56.010 --> 00:39:01.619
is enough for our look


588
00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:05.609
after them. Then we can let them free.


589
00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:15.178
All of them, all of them out for exercise.


590
00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:17.879
But now is a not many people. For now, Storm


591
00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:19.858
is still the king of the canyon, but not


592
00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:21.808
for much longer


593
00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:26.939
the Averty  wants all his tigers to be


594
00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:29.038
together in the canyon soon.  What the


595
00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:31.618
Averty is lacking in  monks he is more


596
00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:34.258
than making up for in visitors  since the


597
00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:36.058
start of the tiger island project. News


598
00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:44.969
of this monastery and its tigers have


599
00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:47.098
been spreading far and wide.  The


600
00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:49.948
monastery is slowly becoming another in


601
00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:52.499
Thailand mini animal attractions. It is


602
00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:54.568
unexpected but for the abbot it maybe


603
00:39:52.500 --> 00:40:00.598
the Lifeline he needs for his tigers.


604
00:39:54.570 --> 00:40:03.479
Because he eats 1000 Baht a day, all of


605
00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:06.568
them. So we are Buddhist, we  can't we can't


606
00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:10.229
have any money, just  donation from the


607
00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:12.839
tourists and the money they can buy the


608
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:19.499
food for the boar, white boar for buffalo


609
00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:23.609
and for every animal to come here to eat.


610
00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:27.149
In the future,  I believe that the areas


611
00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:30.659
around will change because more


612
00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:35.969
tourists come. You know some business will


613
00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:38.999
happen. Kanchanaburi used to be a


614
00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:42.148
tourist spot in terms of the  River Kwai,


615
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:45.959
and the train, the bridge like that.


616
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:49.348
like that, that's very sad, a


617
00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:53.249
tragedy history. But now the new spot


618
00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:56.249
here, very joyful. When they came here to


619
00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:58.249
see, they will be happy with the


620
00:40:56.250 --> 00:41:01.038
tranquil environment.


621
00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:03.618
The tourists are not the only ones


622
00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:06.109
enjoying the peace and tranquility, the


623
00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:08.028
mother of the cubs, Sunta One, meaning some


624
00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:10.939
being, is out again for the first time


625
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:13.279
since giving birth. She is frisky today,


626
00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:17.928
excited to have the chance to show her


627
00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:20.179
affection towards her mate, Storm. They


628
00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:21.769
have two sets of cubs together now, but


629
00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:24.888
the  abbot hopes they will have more.


630
00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:33.678
Their mutual adoration is almost human.


631
00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:35.718
Storm is dominant to the canyon, but only


632
00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:36.948
because one of the abbot tigers    is


633
00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:42.258
still missing.


634
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:51.229
Maybe tomorrow we can bring him out.


635
00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:53.269
But he’s on heat now. There


636
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:55.428
are  now enough monks to handle Mac if


637
00:41:53.270 --> 00:42:02.948
things get ugly with Storm.  The two


638
00:41:55.430 --> 00:42:20.558
tigers  are finally to get their showdown.


639
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:25.778
The  Army is back, the tiger island is


640
00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:27.308
starting to take shape.  The huge boulders


641
00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:32.409
are no match for the newly purchased


642
00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:34.778
explosives. In order to preserve the


643
00:42:32.410 --> 00:42:41.258
tigers existence here,  their old way of


644
00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:43.539
life will be consigned to history.  Each


645
00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:45.879
load of  Earth removed brings the tigers


646
00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:50.528
one step closer to a new life under the


647
00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:52.779
guise of visiting tourists. The abbot is


648
00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:54.969
unwittingly adding a new attraction to


649
00:42:52.780 --> 00:43:02.449
the long list of  wildlife destinations


650
00:42:54.970 --> 00:43:16.428
in  Thailand.


651
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:18.258
This is  Tiger Tourism in Thailand, just


652
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:20.269
to our South of the capital Bangkok.


653
00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:22.459
Tourists gather to indulge their


654
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:26.087
fascination with the  danger and beauty of


655
00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:30.499
the big cats. Here  tigers entertain the crowds


656
00:43:26.089 --> 00:43:32.298
with tricks.  They are healthy animals but


657
00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:41.808
they must work for a living.


658
00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:44.088
They must attract the crowds.


659
00:43:41.809 --> 00:43:48.048
People come here and there curious  to


660
00:43:44.089 --> 00:43:50.298
see newborn tiger cubs suckling a pig. The


661
00:43:48.049 --> 00:43:54.798
mother tigress is giving the piglets the care


662
00:43:50.299 --> 00:43:58.817
for. It is a curious spectacle that draws


663
00:43:54.799 --> 00:44:00.888
people from near and far.  How is the


664
00:43:58.819 --> 00:44:03.107
monastery and its tigers going to find a


665
00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:07.337
place in these existing frameworks of


666
00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:09.077
tiger tourism. Now we have no policy to


667
00:44:07.339 --> 00:44:11.837
be a zoo.


668
00:44:09.079 --> 00:44:16.578
It cannot be like that, it depends on the


669
00:44:11.839 --> 00:44:21.678
management, making a system.


670
00:44:16.579 --> 00:44:25.338
So we need support from experienced


671
00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:29.508
and skilled person to help us manage this


672
00:44:25.339 --> 00:44:34.368
this thing.


673
00:44:29.509 --> 00:44:35.928
They are in  unchartered territory, there


674
00:44:34.369 --> 00:44:40.607
is simply no where else to draw a


675
00:44:35.929 --> 00:44:42.528
comparison. It is going to be a delicate


676
00:44:40.609 --> 00:44:44.807
balancing act between the spirit of the


677
00:44:42.529 --> 00:44:49.129
monastery and the demands of commercial


678
00:44:44.809 --> 00:44:51.708
tourism. In the company of his beloved


679
00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:53.688
tigers, Anchanaburi has a lot to

680
00:44:51.709 --> 00:44:55.968
ponder on his  favourite  trip of the week


681
00:44:53.689 --> 00:45:06.919
to watch the young tigers play in the


682
00:44:55.969 --> 00:45:08.899
cool waters of the River Kwai.


683
00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:10.759
And knowingly they are playing on the


684
00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:16.817
foundations of the long destroyed


685
00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:18.919
wartime River Kwai Bridge. The amateurs


686
00:45:16.819 --> 00:45:22.008
promised himself that his tigers will


687
00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:24.469
become an inspiration for this area. From


688
00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:26.209
the remnants of such sorrow, he is trying


689
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:32.718
to build up a new sense of happiness


690
00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:36.229
and  a love for all living things.


691
00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:38.958
That is all in the future, for today


692
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:45.049
there is one last promise for the abbot


693
00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:47.118
to  fulfil. The monks are about to tackle


694
00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:52.909
something more volatile  and gunpowder.


695
00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:54.828
The 250 kilograms male tiger Mac, the


696
00:45:52.910 --> 00:46:07.519
abbot finally has enough manpower to


697
00:45:54.830 --> 00:46:09.649
bring him out. On his arrival of the


698
00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:15.529
Canyon, he tries again to assert his


699
00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:18.019
dominance. All stand aside to let him


700
00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:20.269
have the pool to himself, but the old


701
00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:27.698
score with Storm still needs to be


702
00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:40.629
settled.


703
00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:43.087
In the wild, they would fight to the


704
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:45.699
death, but here neither tiger gets


705
00:46:43.089 --> 00:46:49.209
hurt in this exchange. It's play-acting


706
00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:52.837
under the abbots come control, all animals


707
00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:54.368
here  coexist in peaceful harmony.


708
00:46:52.839 --> 00:46:57.638
This place is doing an incredible job.


709
00:46:54.369 --> 00:47:00.639
They never intended this place to be a


710
00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:02.528
zoo to keep tigers to benefit themselves


711
00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:04.419
or anyone else for that matter. They


712
00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:06.399
rescued the animals. They're playful,


713
00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:09.189
they're happy, they're  mating, which is a


714
00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:10.837
great sign and if they manage to find


715
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:12.459
some professional help that there is a


716
00:47:10.839 --> 00:47:15.019
great potential as a rehabilitation


717
00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:19.279
center.


718
00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:22.098
Watchanhuset can finally see his dreams


719
00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:24.738
coming true.


720
00:47:22.099 --> 00:47:27.379
This simple man has pursued untried and


721
00:47:24.739 --> 00:47:40.419
untested principles of raising wild


722
00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:43.299
predators and seems to be making it work.


723
00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:45.578
Conservationists in the  West may not


724
00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:48.879
recognize these as accepted methods of


725
00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:52.658
raising tigers. This is Eastern


726
00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:54.909
conservation. The Western conservation


727
00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:56.858
maybe they think just only wild


728
00:47:54.910 --> 00:48:03.968
should be wild.


729
00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:06.669
Okay. Wild cannot turn to be like tame or too


730
00:48:03.970 --> 00:48:09.308
close to the human being.


731
00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:14.529
Eastern Conservation, it means


732
00:48:09.310 --> 00:48:19.359
happiness. Whenever you see the tiger


733
00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:27.858
happy, that it mean just successful in


734
00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:32.538
conservation.


735
00:48:27.859 --> 00:48:34.939
And with his faith in the goodness and


736
00:48:32.539 --> 00:48:37.729
compassion of human nature, this


737
00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:42.258
remarkable man will not rest until his


738
00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:44.149
tigers are finally living in peace.  All


739
00:48:42.259 --> 00:48:47.298
of human being in the world, we can stay


740
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:52.159
in the peace, not fighting in the


741
00:48:47.299 --> 00:48:56.629
war. Like my friend, my father, my mother


742
00:48:52.160 --> 00:49:00.678
and  everything and every every people


743
00:48:56.630 --> 00:49:03.528
and every animal here, we have the same


744
00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:06.107
blood, the blood is red. When you


745
00:49:03.529 --> 00:49:09.078
take, it’s red. We are the same blood.


746
00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:15.247
We just different about the


747
00:49:09.079 --> 00:49:15.248
species, that's all.
