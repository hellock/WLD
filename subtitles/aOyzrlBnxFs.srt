1
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:07.809
She's got one. Tigers are generally
said to succeed just one time out of


2
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.808
10, but this tiger kills on average
every third try.


3
00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.168
She needs to be good. Her cubs have
already got huge appetites


4
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.859
and by the time they leave her, they will weigh
eight times as much.


5
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.008
Even at this size,


6
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.429
each cub consumes around two kilos of meet


7
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.648
at a single sitting.


8
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.849
The camera elephants take a bath
every day. They work for five hours at a


9
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:36.449
stretch


10
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.449
then the rest of the day is that round.


11
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.789
In the sweltering summer, this daily
ritual brings much needed relief


12
00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.669
from the heat. The cubs


13
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.447
also like a cooling dip but the pool by
the den


14
00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:12.448
is not large, and when their mother joins
in, things can get a little crowded.


15
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.939
In spite of the heat,


16
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.898
summer is a good time of year for some of the
forest animals.


17
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.279
These are


18
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.369
among the rarest sloth


19
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.359
bears. They only venture out during the
day in the most secluded places


20
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.839
but spy cam was there to record them.
They are feasting


21
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.839
on formal food.


22
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.728
Wild boar


23
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:33.728
also partial to food. Most animals fear


24
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.299
sloth bears as but not apparently wild


25
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:46.299
boar, at least not in this food around.


26
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.829
Although that is pain for all,
it is sometimes necessary for the bears


27
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:07.829
to show who is boss. The bear cubs


28
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.159
are walking out where they stand in the
pecking order,


29
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.099
they are aggressive creatures by nature and
will face down even the biggest


30
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.939
predators,


31
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.939
but they must show no fear.


32
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.569
Even so, for the youngsters, things sometimes get
just too much


33
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:42.569
and it's time to retreat. The tigers


34
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.319
have moved from their small and shrinking
bathtub


35
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.589
to a more commodious bathing pool,
a reservoir


36
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.779
built by the local people to provide
some with water throughout the year.


37
00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.779
It's a great place to cool down. The
sambar deers


38
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:10.189
are feeling the heat too.


39
00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:18.499
The wild boars


40
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.059
also enjoy a mud bath and combining the
wallow with the meal


41
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.059
just doubles the pleasure.


42
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.709
Mud bathing is clearly enjoyable


43
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:45.709
but it also helps animals get rid of
ticks and other skin parasites.


46
00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.589
The tigers


47
00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.909
have yet found the perfect spot. Cubs


48
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:07.909
are off the shade. Tigers


49
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.449
are one of the few cats that actually
enjoy swimming


50
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.979
and they usually pick den sites close to
water. As they travel around the


51
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.439
territories during the summer,


52
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.749
they move as quickly as possible through
the dryer parts


53
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:29.749
to get to the hunting grounds that would
have bathing places.


54
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.749
As June comes to an end, the heat becomes
really hard to bear.


55
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.739
Midday temperatures can reach 45 degrees
in the shade,


56
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.789
but after a bath the water


57
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.089
evaporating from the fur cools the
body and brings enough relief


58
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:54.119
for the animal to sleep with. When the monsoon
finally


59
00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:01.119
arrives, it's not moment too soon


60
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.989
As weather has been bringing a welcome drop in
temperature


61
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.089
the rain replenish the ponds, puddle and pools.


62
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:48.659
There is greenery everywhere.


64
00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.899
The giant to me to WebDAV golden all


65
00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:58.899
spiders hand between trees.


66
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.319
There are the biggest spiders' webs in the
world,


67
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.929
national concurring ropes sometimes
scratch across


68
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.319
six meter gaps. The elephant are


69
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:19.319
about to march through them. The
spiders themselves


70
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.709
have a span as wide as a human hand but
today are of no consequence to an elephant.


71
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:32.369
Their web


72
00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:37.319
is strong enough to catch a small bird
but the spiders in fact feed only


73
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:42.979
on insects. Cubs


74
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:46.229
are just over a year old and they have
an appetite


75
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:52.469
to match their size, but there has been


76
00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:56.249
a significant change in their behavior.
Their play


77
00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:59.439
now includes mock hunting with mother


78
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:06.439
serving as a target.


79
00:08:24.119 --> 00:08:27.498
This is a stylized fighting. It looks


80
00:08:27.499 --> 00:08:30.958
dangerous and aggressive but the cubs keep
their paws


81
00:08:30.959 --> 00:08:37.958
fully throughout. Mother


82
00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:42.757
never takes part in their fighting games
but indulgently


83
00:08:42.759 --> 00:08:49.758
tolerates the cubs' boisterous behavior.


84
00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:10.209
They spend a lot of time traveling. Five


85
00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:17.209
nearly full size tigers on the move
together is a rare sight indeed.


86
00:09:24.279 --> 00:09:28.199
They are a formidable force, nothing
stays around


87
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:35.199
to challenge them.


88
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:48.838
Even the weather is now cooler, they still
bath


89
00:09:48.839 --> 00:09:55.838
on the hottest part of the day. Water is
difficult to resist.


90
00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:12.518
The cubs take new notice whatever at the
elephants,


91
00:10:12.519 --> 00:10:16.569
so it's possible to get really into a
chaos from the camera Helton


92
00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:23.569
truck.


93
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:31.088
Progress through the forest is slow because
they link at


94
00:10:31.089 --> 00:10:38.088
almost every pool allstream.


95
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:57.359
They're not alone in relishing the abundance of water.
The langur monkeys and their


96
00:10:58.509 --> 00:11:05.508
babies seem to have not to care in the
world,


97
00:11:22.899 --> 00:11:26.549
but for some babies drinking isn't the
most comfortable of


98
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:33.549
times.


99
00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:39.958
Unlike mechanics, langurs are the friends
of spotted deer.


100
00:11:39.959 --> 00:11:46.958
They share the task of keeping a lookout
for their greatest enemy.


101
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:56.599
The time has come for the tigers to make
a determined hunt.


102
00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:03.819
One of her cubs decides to go with her to
get some


103
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:10.819
personal tuition,


104
00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:23.268
the rest prefer to take it easy.
They are now starting to behaviors


105
00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:27.198
individuals, each making its own
decisions about what each


106
00:12:27.199 --> 00:12:34.198
do.


107
00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:39.919
The tigers doesn't need to look far for
a meal, she's in one of the most


108
00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.419
productive parts of trees.


109
00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:46.079
She hasn't been here for some time
so she has more chance of catching a


110
00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.349
pray of god.


111
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:50.349
The lush


112
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:57.349
undergrowth gives her a cover.


113
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:18.058
Her pray she quite i'm concerned.


114
00:13:18.059 --> 00:13:24.218
But not for long the cup


115
00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:28.258
still to learn that this sort of
behaviour is not what is needed


116
00:13:28.259 --> 00:13:35.258
when mother is trying to hunt. The langur
send a warning far and wide,


117
00:13:40.179 --> 00:13:47.178
but still


118
00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:56.849
the cub doesn't calm down. The cub


119
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:21.888
is now testing his mother's patience to
the limit. She warns him


120
00:14:21.889 --> 00:14:25.338
that enough is enough.


121
00:14:25.339 --> 00:14:31.489
The rest of the cubs


122
00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:34.638
are contained to wait and two cheese
course something


123
00:14:34.639 --> 00:14:41.638
that shows just how well fed they are.


124
00:14:45.819 --> 00:14:48.877
Her prey soon relax the pools


125
00:14:48.879 --> 00:14:49.758
are beginning to dry.
