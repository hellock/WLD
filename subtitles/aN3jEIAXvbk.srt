1
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.758
Outback Australia,


2
00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:11.348
an unforgiving territory and a land of
amazing creatures,


3
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.038
where sometimes nature needs a helping
hand.


4
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:26.379
These are the everyday heroes found by a
single mission to save wildlife anywhere


5
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.409
anytime.


6
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.839
In this episode of outback wildlife
rescue, took his care back three months ago.


7
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.968
Will Archimedes the koala ever return
to the wild?


8
00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.948
He’s not even trying to fight us off. The
ways to save this need cut.


9
00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:48.349
I don't know how anyone could do this to. The
big one you can see it there and over here.


10
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.729
And an uninvited guest who refuses to
leave the dinner table.


11
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.088
It's like a restaurant, an the outback
restaurant for these guys.


12
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:09.499
Australia is a massive continent, from
the tropical Queensland Aoast to what's


13
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.018
called the top-end, Darwin.


14
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.318
At the monsoonal wetlands that surround
and South


15
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.628
through the arid interior to the red
deserts of Alice Springs and field.


16
00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.318
An hour up the Queensland Coast from
Brisbane,


17
00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:36.949
there's a vet clinic like no other, the
Australian wildlife hospital and be a


18
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.628
while. They’re lining up in the doorway now. All
the sealed the cages that are starting to


19
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.758
appear. The day begins.


20
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.189
It's a non-stop 24-hour mash-up
clinic. Next,


21
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.839
I think I've got more flying foxes. Ah, think
I've got possibly a kangaroo and that's a


22
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.819
whole stack of birds waiting as well, so


23
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.278
planning to do for the next few hours.
Everyday they get called to help


24
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.829
hundred or more rescued creatures and
they’re queuing up from the crack of dawn.


25
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.539
Lots of our animals because they're nocturnal
get it the night before and they found


26
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.948
during the early hours, the mornings. So,


27
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.608
most mornings tend to be like this. We’ll
busy out. Gail Gipp manages the hospital.


28
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.249
John Hangers, the senior vet. Still
feel it a bit of moment. They're hardened to the fact that


29
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.999
more than two-thirds of the animals
brought here have either been hit by a


30
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.659
car or attacked by a family dog. Dog
attack


31
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.369
injuries are toriously hard to fix
because they often have very severe


32
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.539
internal injuries


33
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.678
so they're hard to. You know they're
challenging patient to get through any


34
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.679
way. We probably saved on our own ,maybe
fifty percent of them.


35
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.128
A quarter of the patients are koalas
and this morning has been a bad one for


36
00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.869
them. Its got a fracture her, right? Actually, I
have call


37
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.418
this rounded.


38
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.728
Despite their looks, koalas aren't bears,
they're marsupials,


39
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.128
uniquely adapted for Australian life.
Their front paws each have two thumbs to


40
00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:22.158
help them climb and inside there's an
organ like an appendix 2 meters long to


41
00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.458
help digest the tough eucalyptus leaves
they ate.


42
00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.049
Of course what they can't do is adapt to
people


43
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.879
in between cars and habitat loss some
estimate their population to be as low


44
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.879
as 100,000.


45
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.859
It's fun


46
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.859
at the moment, it’s a car hitch. She was hit at
seven o'clock this morning.


47
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.078
We unsure the extent of their injuries at
the moment up and that she's in a lot of


48
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.079
pain and just got quite a swollen face.


49
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.668
One end is working on


50
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.939
was hit last night.


51
00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.939
She's gotten internal


52
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.029
damage and isn't it also in a lot of
pain.


53
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.859
And the one in there is a boy that came in
yesterday that has spinal injuries.


54
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.847
Each of these koalas faces a long
difficult road to recovery. Be great.


55
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:23.909
It's a journey Archimedes is all too
familiar with. Three months ago his life


56
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.259
hung in the balance on an operating
table too, but everyone's hoping today


57
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.679
he'll get the all-clear to return to the
world.


58
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.589
Katherine lies 300 kilometers south of
Darwin,


59
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.589
in the northern territory.


60
00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.899
Ten thousand people trading the border
between the desert and the tropics and


61
00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.389
one of them is on a wildlife rescue
mission.


62
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.839
We've just received a call from a lady
on the other side of town who has a big


63
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.909
snake she says it’s in a chock pain. So, I will
hit there straight away and hopefully save


64
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.909
her and the snake.


65
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.789
David Reed really is his name calling has
the government contract to rescue


66
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:29.219
wildlife here about. He answers 500 calls
out every year, all at the ripe old age


67
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.669
of 21.


68
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:35.139
It was what I was born to do, it’s my ideal
job, it’s my ideal passion and I just


69
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.139
consider myself so lucky to be able to
do what I did.


70
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.669
So for really, this is a labor of love.


71
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:49.599
Every rescue is a chance to save an
animal and help a human. Morning, how are you?


72
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.129
I’m good. How are you? Thanks for coming
out so quick. That’s alright. Aren’t you say
you got another snake? Did you?


73
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.799
It is great and it has greet us already


74
00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.699
Oh well looked after you got time for it.
Absolutely. Where has he been hiding?


75
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.299
He’s up in the corner where there’s a
bag and roasters are there as they use to do.


76
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.989
they're all in there still


77
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.709
Reeding choking now but he's going to
have his hands full


78
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.029
Steven Carter and Lisa Handsome run Darwin’s
Ark Animal Hospital.


79
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:32.429
When it comes to injured wildlife that's
a more than must around here but by


80
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.899
the side of the road


81
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.009
they've stumbled onto one of the most
shocking scenes either of them have ever


82
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:43.439
encountered. Had to believe but we've
just come across this kite here.


83
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.869
He wasn't easy to spot is just right
down the riverbank. Some horrible person


84
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.689
has made a snared trap bed and it swayed.


85
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.589
It's just been hanging by one wing and tell
how long. Long enough. Look


86
00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.669
there’s no leaves around like here. So, it’s been here for
a while. It’s been in this state for a while.


87
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:04.139
He's not even he's not even trying to
fight us off. He is covered in ants is just


88
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:10.319
poor thing at and I don't know how
anyone could do this to. It's a whistling


89
00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.669
kite, a bird of prey common across
main land Australia.


90
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:21.809
This was young and didn't know enough to
avoid the snare. Lisa and Stephen are his


91
00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:22.829
only hope.


92
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:31.589
He's just a baby he haven't greet
welcome to the world. Can I take you out?


93
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.109
You can see. Yes it’s swollen.


94
00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.769
Poor sweet heart. at the moment it's
really swollen.


95
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.859
say there's certainly not going to be a
lot of soft tissue damage and possibly


96
00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.679
even some permanent damage to the blood
supply


97
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.739
that destroy the trap. We don't want
anyone else getting caught in it.



98
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:03.459
See people putting them in a trap.
I can't believe it.


99
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:07.209
Let's have a look at the swing can have
to make sure we get all the cotton off


100
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:11.079
because it's going to act like a ton
of cocaine and became the blood supply


101
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:15.309
off to the end of the wing is
undoubtedly quite dehydrated and a fair


102
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.649
degree of shock and he's giving up.


103
00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:21.219
You can see here so the placides and
we really need to get him back to the


104
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.109
clinic.


105
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.859
Thank you.


106
00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:31.899
In Katherine, Reed is moving in to
tackle what’s apparently a very big snake


107
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.719
in Marylyn's henhouse. Snakes


108
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.439
you know in Katherine are a particular
favorite animal and a lot of people are


109
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.579
still scared of them.


110
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.939
So you're trying to save the snake and
you know save the people at the same


111
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:49.869
time. The snake can get in but then he
has a meal and has a trouble getting


112
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:53.979
back  out. The large lump. So he'll
find a nice shady spot, kill out there


113
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.439
and try to digest food on the days.


114
00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.859
He certainly is a big one you can see it
there and over here.


115
00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:04.029
It's an olive python which can grow more
than four meters long.


116
00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:10.389
They're not venomous and kill their
pride by constricting it until it


117
00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:11.759
suffocates.


118
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:17.579
More often that's wallabies or lizards or
in this case a slow chicken.


119
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:21.149
He's coming here looking for dinner. He's
found that last night.


120
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.629
People that keep a lot of chucks or
even birds and everything like this.


121
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:29.099
It's like a restaurant, an outback
restaurant for these guys so it really


122
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.969
is a big attraction and it's not an
uncommon circumstances found among this.


123
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:41.249
Really has to catch this snake and it's
not to be taken like this. He's not poisonous,


124
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:44.249
but you can still give a nasty bite.


125
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:50.129
All right we'll see if we can get him
out and get him away and save some of


126
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.029
the rest of the chucks.


127
00:09:53.030 --> 00:10:01.759
Respect is my golden rule when working
with snakes. Certainly it’s a big snake. He’s


128
00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:08.179
probably going on near three mavis and
he's a little bit defensive you can see


129
00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:13.189
in there. Snakes will very vulnerable at
this sort of time like he's got a rather


130
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:17.899
large food source in him and he's
sitting there saying that “You know I'm


131
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.809
vulnerable, I can't move this last. That's
what I normally do.


132
00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:25.189
Stay away my long body. So we'll see if
we can pick him up. This nice and easy.


133
00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:43.549
In due while, the operating theatre is still
full of sick koalas. Have sever bash on the


134
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:44.569
head


135
00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:50.979
And out in the recovery area, Archimedes
is waiting his turn for treatment.


136
00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.449
He's had a rough time.


137
00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:57.549
His care about three months ago and he
had a fractured jaw so these are the


138
00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:00.549
x-rays or some of the x-rays of
Archimedes when it came in.


139
00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:07.089
The fracture that he had is a symphyseal
fracture, fracture through the centre of


140
00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:07.869
the jaw.


141
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:10.328
So that the treatment for, um,


142
00:11:10.329 --> 00:11:15.058
the fractured synthesis just really
involves wiring together the two


143
00:11:15.059 --> 00:11:21.867
in sizes on the lower jaw. It sounds
simple enough, but Archimedes had other


144
00:11:21.869 --> 00:11:22.768
ideas.


145
00:11:22.769 --> 00:11:28.018
He kept breaking those wires. Fractured
jaw fell apart three times on us and we


146
00:11:28.019 --> 00:11:29.788
have to repair it consistently,


147
00:11:29.789 --> 00:11:34.978
so he was touching go for a long time.
Now at long last,


148
00:11:34.979 --> 00:11:40.528
they're hoping his jaw is probably yield,
but they need to check with a final


149
00:11:40.529 --> 00:11:43.528
examination.


150
00:11:45.059 --> 00:11:48.058
That sedative will stop him struggling
and hurting himself.


151
00:11:48.569 --> 00:11:51.117
it's a really big day for Archimedes,
because we didn't think he was gonna


152
00:11:51.119 --> 00:11:53.888
make it back to the wild.


153
00:11:53.889 --> 00:11:54.979
With luck,


154
00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.429
by the time he wakes up he'll finally be
ready to go home.


155
00:12:02.019 --> 00:12:08.888
We'll see if we can pick him out this
nice and easy.


156
00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:18.479
Snakes have amazing sensors you can see
him flicking his tongue like that.


157
00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.529
The thing it is this to be nice and
gentle and sometime the snake


158
00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:24.059
really doesn't want to hurt you.


159
00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:29.159
And once he feels that you're not a
threat, he's normally quite happy. Just to


160
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.959
try and work yourself away rather than
restricting dividing or trying to hurt you so.


161
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:39.989
But you can really see that's quite a
large lump and that will probably be a


162
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:44.789
couple of kilos with food so it probably
might have been the first time that he's


163
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:50.339
eaten possibly in bed four five
maybe even six months after the dry


164
00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:54.419
season. So we sort of compare the size of
that lump to the size of his head.


165
00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:59.459
They really is quite a huge difference
so it's amazing the muscles that snakes


166
00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:06.089
can use to stretch edge or and allow
them to swallow such big prey. Turns out


167
00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:11.069
Reedies quite the snake charmer but
Marylyn still keeping a distance. If you


168
00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:12.299
live in the territory, you


169
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:16.049
you have to be prepared to live with
snakes because that's part a lot up here


170
00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:22.079
and it seems if you've got chuck's you
have snakes. Alright, nice and easy into the


171
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.199
bag.


172
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.189
Up here they have a unique way of
measuring big snakes.


173
00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:31.989
He's probably about 15 kilos which is
equivalent to two cases of beer so quite


174
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:37.119
substantial for Australian snake. The
girls in the henhouse are breathing a big


175
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.099
sigh of relief.


176
00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:44.439
Now the challenge for Reed is to find a
safe place to release the snake.


177
00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:59.149
In Darwin, Stephen and Lisa have brought the
injured whistling kite back to the Ark.


178
00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.119
Its feet. Let's have a look at it.


179
00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:06.439
They found him hanging in a trap and
exhausted from the struggle.


180
00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.439
Okay. Kites are hunters.


181
00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.439
Their site is thousands of times better
than ours.


182
00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:17.239
They'll drop on mice and lizards from
more than a hundred meters up, but this


183
00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.249
one won't be doing that for a while.


184
00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:23.089
This guy's been hanging from his wing
and it's very common for them to


185
00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:28.909
break their core bland. That shows a
bit sore, a bit wrench that the anti-inflammatories


186
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:31.069
should help to let down


187
00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:34.849
make him feel better. I just feel like the
moment for any breaks or fractures


188
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:41.839
so at the damage is still a lot of
swelling. It doesn't appear to be any


189
00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.889
break, so already significant damage
there. We’ll take an x-ray to confirm


190
00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:51.589
that’s all attack. All things considered
the kites in remarkably good shape.


191
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:55.309
X-ray. With that engine wing,


192
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:58.759
there's no way he can be set free yet. we
got a training with some


193
00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:05.179
anti-inflammatories and antibiotics and
time. He's going to need some looking


194
00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.598
after for a while and Lisa


195
00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.639
as a unique halfway house in mind.


196
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:17.839
In Katherine, Reedies got a whole bag of
olive python to deal with. But for the


197
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.949
time good,


198
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:23.119
he won't be setting it free just here.
With the olive python that we got this


199
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.269
morning on the call out in chock pain.
We’ll decide to


200
00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:29.809
put him in his top here leaving peace
and quiet,


201
00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:36.649
let him digest his meal without any
stress and we go. You got to remember


202
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:43.429
this snake again like he's being keep
up nice and tight in the bag, away from


203
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:48.499
stress, away from any other people and
this order to help him keep quiet. Reedies


204
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:52.669
handling the python with a lot of care
because right now there's a risk that


205
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:56.689
chicken dinner could come back up again.
If you stretch it up too much,


206
00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:00.349
one thing they might do is actually
regurgitated and the best thing for the


207
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:05.119
snake is to actually let him keep that
meal down and digest and get all the


208
00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.559
value from it that he can.


209
00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:10.999
So we'll put him here nice and quiet. It
may seem like a small box for a big


210
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.289
snake but within the next week or until
we go. I guess the meal,


211
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:19.519
he won't be moving a hell of a lot
anyways. He will be quite happy to have a


212
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.799
nice environment where


213
00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.989
he can sit down, curl up and not be disturbed.


214
00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:35.489
Archimedes time has finally come be a
while,


215
00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:38.699
he's been anaesthetised for his
examination.


216
00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:46.079
So, how’s it been going to sure? He was hit
by a car and broke his jaw. To tighten


217
00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.219
and then.


218
00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:50.698
It's a problem they see almost every day
here at the clinic.


219
00:16:50.699 --> 00:16:54.239
They’re so small. They really bump about
the level for a lot of cars and they


220
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.799
usually come off really badly


221
00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.088
which is unfortunate for them.


222
00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:14.789
John can't take any chances if
Archimedes is free too soon. He won't be


223
00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.739
able to feed and he die.


224
00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:20.848
Just we're doing that final check before
they release and the warn just to make


225
00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:23.368
sure that we haven’t overlooked
something or they haven't developed


226
00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:25.339
another condition while they been here.


227
00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:29.359
It's basically just a thorough
general physical examination like they


228
00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:37.009
might receive when they when they first
admitted. I think people realise


229
00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:40.339
the states of the koalas and


230
00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.979
the realities that they will be gone from
urban areas in


231
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.298
a lifetime,


232
00:17:45.299 --> 00:17:48.369
I think that we are responsible for that,


233
00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:51.369
and we owe them so much.


234
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:57.229
Every koala released back to the wild
matters


235
00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:00.229
but can Archimedes be set free?


236
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.639
Reedies on his way to release the
troublesome olive python.


237
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:11.989
He’s digested his stolen chicken and
really knows exactly the right place to


238
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:15.419
set him free.


239
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.419
Down by the river and away from people.


240
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:23.938
All pythons love the water. This is
an ideal environment for him, so we'll


241
00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:28.798
let him go, let him adapt into his new
environment and you know hopefully will


242
00:18:28.799 --> 00:18:34.979
be a safe and happy life going to
continue on living away from people. Olive


243
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:39.119
Pythons in this sort of habitat along
the river corridor would quite often come


244
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:43.589
across maybe some possums, you know large
birds probably even ducks or something


245
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:48.239
like that. You know their food source in
the river corridor is abundant,


246
00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.928
so that's why it's a good environment to
release a snake especially big you know


247
00:18:51.929 --> 00:18:54.599
olive python which commonly
preys on you know birds or mammals


248
018:54.600 --> 00:19:00.269
marsupials. There will be a lead let him
go and hopefully by the time it warms up


249
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:05.369
a bit later the day. He will have found a
place to you know hard up and sit at the


250
00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:08.369
day then probably come out at night
seeing pythons are nocturnal.


251
00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:24.188
He’ll be nice and happy so not a chuck
pain from are hoping the chucks are safe,


252
00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:27.189
the snake safe and I can all live
happily ever after.


253
00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:37.439
The whistling kites life is on the up,


254
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.038
Lisa and Stephen free him from the snare


255
00:19:40.039 --> 00:19:44.569
and he's largely uninjured. He's had a
lucky escape,


256
00:19:45.409 --> 00:19:49.248
which is ironic given he's about to
become a jail bird.


257
00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:54.408
Very good thanks. For getting new edition
for you are. Just as good as it.


258
00:19:54.409 --> 00:19:59.928
He's a little whistling kite. The
Ark help set up a program at Darwins


259
00:19:59.929 --> 00:20:04.158
Prison where inmates like volunteer
to help injured wildlife.


260
00:20:05.299 --> 00:20:13.908
Hey you can say yeah. This wing here you can
so if you pull out


261
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:18.888
you can see he got, you can see
how he’s all swollen and he’s looking a


262
00:20:18.889 --> 00:20:22.938
little bit better but not good but if
you compare it to the other wing


263
00:20:23.509 --> 00:20:29.418
it's quite seek. What do you reckon? The
guides pretty much guaranteed 24-hour


264
00:20:29.419 --> 00:20:34.488
care and in just 12 months more than 150
animals have passed through here.


265
00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:42.199
That's really good is actually used both
swings there like that main certainly


266
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.869
hasn't got any significant nerve damage.
So,


267
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:48.529
he shouldn't be here for too long. Yep,
that's right that's very good sign.


268
00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:51.829
Yeah shouldn't take him too long and
he'll be up and flying around with the


269
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:53.719
other birds. He’ll used to it.


270
00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:57.259
Yeah, thanks Stanley. Thanks. See you later.


271
00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:01.009
The kite’s journey wont’ end here,
provided all goes well.


272
00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:04.759
Lisa will be back to spring him in a
month.


273
00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:10.069
This is another good day we've managed
to rescue this little bird and send him


274
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:14.539
up here and I've seen him fly. I know he's
going to be ready for release.


275
00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:17.539
It's just a fantastic day, it’s a good day.


276
00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:24.149
And it's a good day in via too.
Archimedes has passed his physical,


277
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.959
he's almost time.


278
00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:34.139
Koalas a territorial little creatures.
Kate from the release team is putting


279
00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:37.139
Archimedes back near the old haunt where
it was found.


280
00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:45.609
He's ready to go that’s for sure.
Hey buddy.


281
00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:20.119
That’s him calling.


282
00:22:25.389 --> 00:22:29.438
Getting back to his territory is letting
everyone know he’s home and he's a young


283
00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:35.168
man so he's going to give a party
tonight I don't know. But he’s certainly happy to


284
00:22:35.169 --> 00:22:38.168
be back.


285
00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:46.939
Flay gums is one of their favourite food
sources, so he's gonna


286
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:55.919
have plenty to eat here forever. It’s great.
Archimedes releases one small victory in


287
00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.499
the battle to help a species survive.


288
00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.499
Young and healthy,


289
00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:08.879
he could breed for the next 10 years so
hopefully this little woman could make a


290
00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.879
big difference.


291
00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:20.508
That's a baby,


292
00:23:20.509 --> 00:23:22.409
that's a lot,


293
00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:25.409
it's just a little animal.


294
00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:29.989
To be out to release it that to show you
that you doing your job well.


295
00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:35.389
It’s fantastic. The best feeling on this
planet I think.


296
00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:38.168
I love it
