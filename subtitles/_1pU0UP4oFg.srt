1
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:28.697
The tiger, iconic symbol of the wild and
an apex predator that we fear and admire.


2
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.939
In our imaginations, they roam the jungle,


3
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.708
but today many tigers have never even
seen the wild.


4
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.049
The vast majority of them spend their
lives in captivity.


5
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:56.339
Princess is an American tiger, a distant
relative of her wild ancestors.


6
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.909
She doesn't even know how to hunt.


7
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.679
Most Tigers in America aren't found in
zoos,


8
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.679
they're privately owned.


9
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.618
There are more than twice as
many of them as the highly endangered


10
00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.939
wild tiger.


11
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.829
This could change if new legislation has
passed. That would ban the private


12
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.829
ownership in breeding the tigers.


13
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.368
What are the issues surrounding captive
tigers in America and what does the


14
00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.368
future hold for their wild cousins?


15
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.698
Tigers are one of the world's most
popular animals.


16
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.699
Everybody loves to see a tiger at the
zoo,


17
00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.648
even the scientists to work around them
are impressed by the majesty.


18
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.428
Ron Tilson is the senior conservation
advisor at the Minnesota Zoo and a


19
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.219
renowned expert on tigers.


20
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.788
He spent many years tracking and
studying them in the jungles of Asia.


21
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.878
My heart beats faster every time I see
one.


22
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.149
Yeah there is a ... It's because everything...
they represent everything. They are the


23
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.519
icon of Asian wilderness, they are the
most powerful cat, the largest cat.


24
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.419
They are in my opinion one of the most
attractive cats. But it's also the fact


25
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.629
that essentially we have evolved as a
species with the tiger and the tiger is


26
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.668
one of the only animals on earth that
praise and eats people


27
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:43.169
and when a tiger looks at a human being.
I think the tiger sees us for exactly


28
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.168
what we are, we are nothing more than a
piece of meat.


29
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.619
The tiger and the power it represents
has always fascinated us. At the


30
00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.539
beginning of the 20th century,


31
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.779
there are 100,000 tigers in the forests
of Asia.


32
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.198
The first tiger came to America as
entertainers before Susans Circuses


33
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.129
attempted to control their breeding
surplus animals found their way into


34
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.959
private hands.


35
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.269
Soon everyone from the rich and famous
to companies in sports teams wanted a


36
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:28.599
piece of the big cat. For some Americans
like the character of Tony Montana and


37
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.738
the movie Scarface, owning a tiger became
a symbol of success.


38
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.958
Martin Dinnes is a celebrity veterinaria
and was one of the first to specialize


39
00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.039
in exotic animals. His talent and
reputation


40
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.539
let him to work for a-list stars like
Michael Jackson and the magicians


41
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.899
Siegfried and Roy. He witnessed first-hand
the rise of the tiger population in


42
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:05.409
America. The tiger pet phenomenon became
a trend I would say in the early sixties.


43
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.478
We could be driving in Beverly Hills and
see a person driving a convertible with


44
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:20.828
a tiger sitting up in the back seat. Or
people owning a jagwar, a big jaguar


45
00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.129
driving around a new jaguar with it.


46
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:30.189
There were no import restrictions, there
were no restrictions on the sale of pet


47
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.929
shop of these kind of animals. You know a
little tiger cub is nice and cute,


48
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.888
so people thought it would be
fashionable, it was unique,


49
00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:48.189
they can show it off and it was trendy
then. The pet tiger phenomenon may have


50
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.779
existed briefly in other parts of the
world but it never had the dimensions


51
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:58.629
it's taken on in America. In the nineteen
seventies actress, Tippi Hedren, the star


52
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.309
of Alfred Hitchcock "The Birds" and
Bart done an unusual film project.


53
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.779
She starred in the moving "Roar",


54
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.859
where actors and crew members rub
shoulders with dozens of lions and


55
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.179
tigers.


56
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.288
I can't believe we did all that


57
00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.128
that we were foolish enough to do it, so
many of us were hurt.


58
00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:23.598
You know that it was, you know of
insanity.


59
00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:29.478
It was truly insane in here. Tippi Hedren
radically changed.


60
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.299
She converted the "Roar" movie set into
the Shambala Preserve, a sanctuary for


61
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:43.368
abused and neglected big cats. Her strong
stance against private ownership has


62
00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:50.898
drawn attention to the issues facing
captive and wild big cats. In the wild


63
00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:54.288
tigers are threatened by habitat
destruction and human encroachment.


64
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.459
They've been hunted and poached for
their skins.


65
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.469
Most of all they suffered from the
illegal trade of their parts for use in


66
00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.388
traditional medicine.


67
00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:11.339
Ninety-seven percent of the species have
been wiped out over the last hundred


68
00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.499
years and with only 320 hundreds wild tigers
left.


69
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.339
They are facing a total crisis.


70
00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.879
This just about everything has been
tried and just about everything is


71
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:29.848
failed. Everyone is trying to think
through how to go about making a future


72
00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:37.409
for tigers and the bottom line is that we
failed in every, every example. There


73
00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:42.899
is no one place you can put your finger
and say "AHA, here's the magic formula on


74
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.419
how to save tigers."


75
00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:51.479
Tigers have been on the endangered
species list since it was established. In


76
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.919
1973 it became illegal to import tigers
born in the wild,


77
00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:02.099
so the tigers living in the United
States today are American, born and


78
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:10.469
raised. The population of captive tigers
has been steadily growing. In the wild,


80
00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:14.819
a female spends a couple of years
teaching her three or four cubs how to


81
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.539
hunt and fend for themselves. But in
captivity,


82
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:26.219
she can breed every year. Today most
American Tigers are privately owned and


83
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.219
some people still keep them as pets.


84
00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:36.408
Zuzana Kukol and Scott Shoemaker
live in the small town of Pahrump Nevada


85
00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:39.408
with their six tigers.


86
00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:49.848
It's your definition of pet is something
you throw food at and it's nice and


87
00:07:49.849 --> 00:07:50.658
docile.


88
00:07:50.659 --> 00:07:56.869
Okay then that's not a tiger. That's my
girl, that's my girl.


89
00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:04.728
In the cage, it's just fun. Outside
that van it's like, okay we are going for


90
00:08:04.729 --> 00:08:07.249
the walk, we are going to go for the
training,


91
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:12.438
the outside is like you're in school. In
the cage, it's ok, it's their place, it's


92
00:08:12.439 --> 00:08:13.399
their home.


93
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.209
So basically that's the Golden Rule,


94
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:22.758
you don't push them into any set of
training in the cage and you will never


95
00:08:22.759 --> 00:08:29.239
ever turn the back on a tiger. But not
all captive tigers are pets or


96
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:34.609
collectors' items. Some private owners see
themselves as conservationists and


97
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:41.328
believe America is the Tigers Noah's Ark.
Patty Perry runs her own center for


98
00:08:41.328 --> 00:08:44.328
conservation and education in Southern
California.


99
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:50.898
She is also the Vice-President of the
Feline Conservation Federation, the


100
00:08:50.899 --> 00:08:55.729
largest organization promoting private
ownership and breeding of captive exotic


101
00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:57.708
cats in the United States.


102
00:08:57.709 --> 00:09:03.169
It's far from perfect but in our world
today we have to have a captive breeders,


103
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:05.359
private captive breeders,


104
00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.169
we have to have private educators,
because the zoos can't do it all.


105
00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:13.849
You don't get that kind of contact and
that kind of one on one at a zoo.


106
00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:19.909
They have been poached, they have been
hunted for their pelts and for their


107
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:24.679
internal organs and we have very very
low populations.


108
00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.929
This is Prana, the standard.


109
00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:33.939
The snow white is Vishnu. This is my
little red-headed stepchild and this is


110
00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:34.599
the one


111
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.959
the golden tabby. He's gonna be our
biggest tiger here.


112
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:45.849
The Tigers is very much an emotional
bond. They they respond emotionally. I, I


113
00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:49.059
got them all as babies, so I bottle raise
them.


114
00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:53.799
So there is that connection you know,
they identify me is, you know like mom


115
00:09:53.800 --> 00:10:02.409
with milk. Who wants to feed a tiger?
I kind of started on this and give you guys a


116
00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:06.189
chance. I want you to hold the stick, just
hold the stick and put it right through


117
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:09.189
there. Right.


118
00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:17.349
These cats being six generations, you
know captive bred and their, you know,


119
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:21.579
their their primary contact being human
beings are not going to be the same as a


120
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:24.579
cat that's in the wild, it's a completely
different animal.


121
00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:28.838
But i will there be domesticated know
they're wild animals.


122
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:35.708
The wild nature of tigers is seen even
among those in captivity. In 2003, famous


123
00:10:35.709 --> 00:10:37.269
Las Vegas entertainer,


124
00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:42.249
Roy Hrn was mauled during the performance
by one of his beloved tigers.


125
00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:45.559
Tigers just grab him like would
be right around here in this area


126
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.579
grabs and like just locks on him, mix
them up and just drags. And we just heard


127
00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.319
all these commotion behind the


128
00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:55.939
curtain and you could hear. It reminded
everyone that even trained tigers are


129
00:10:55.940 --> 00:11:03.259
unpredictable and dangerous. For 40 years,
those guys did two to three shows a day,


130
00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.589
in the beginning seven days a week.


131
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:12.379
That's a lot of exposure to a tiger. You
fall down and finally these big cats and


132
00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.909
especially with tigers


133
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:20.929
they're gonna carry you regardless of
what your relationship. He's got


134
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:22.129
a thing for me, Patty.


135
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:30.259
I know he does. In my career as a
zoological veterinarian, I worked the


136
00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:35.749
gamut of facilities and owners that have
tigers.


137
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:45.289
There's the zoos, there's the circuses, there's the
private collectors and years ago there


138
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:53.718
were a lot more of the illicit owners of
these animals but I've worked for all of


139
00:11:53.720 --> 00:12:00.829
them and I don't I don't discriminate. I
have done the best I can to discourage


140
00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:10.819
reading by unqualified individuals, but I
I took an oath and isn't my business to


141
00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:14.869
say no I'm not going to treat this tiger
because you own it privately.


142
00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:19.159
That's that's on the other side of
medicine for me.


143
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:29.499
Lisa Ann Tekancic is an attorney in
Washington DC. Her organization, The Wild


144
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:35.049
Cat Conservation Legal Aid Society, is
trying to determine the exact number of


145
00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:39.789
privately-owned tigers. Here calling a
follow up with you on the tiger research


146
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:43.659
you were going to finalize some of the
numbers for what state are you still


147
00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:48.009
working on, what are looking at, alavema?
The actual number of tigers in the


148
00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:53.229
United States is still a matter of
speculation, but the enforcement of laws


149
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:58.479
already in place is problematic.
Legislation varies from state to state.


150
00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:03.039
At the federal level, the Department of
Agriculture and the Department of


151
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.148
Interior both enforce different laws
affecting tigers.


151
00:13:07.149 --> 00:13:12.429
There is no single government body
responsible for tiger welfare.


152
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.419
Well, we don't really know how many
tigers are held captive in the United


153
00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:20.919
States is a very good question because
estimates tend to go all over. Some say


154
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.708
there's five thousand cats and captivity
tigers,


155
00:13:23.709 --> 00:13:29.679
some say there's up to ten. The problem
with the numbering system is that the


156
00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:34.659
two federal agencies that are there to
enforce our endangered species act and


157
00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:34.968
the


158
00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:39.078
the welfare and don't know how many
tigers are out there, which is very


159
00:13:39.079 --> 00:13:44.387
troubling, because we need to get a
handle on the number of cats. As hard as


160
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:46.018
it is to imagine,


161
00:13:46.019 --> 00:13:48.719
big cats can be found everywhere


162
00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.888
even on the fifth floor of an apartment
building in the heart of New York City,


163
00:13:52.889 --> 00:13:59.669
like on an October day in 2003. This
police video shows me all grown


164
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:05.098
325-pound tiger left home alone by its
owner in unit 5-feet of the Harlem


165
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.339
apartment building.


166
00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.759
If the number in the location of big
cats is a source for concern, a


167
00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:15.369
larger concern might just be the
irresponsible owners,


168
00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:20.349
screening for them remains difficult.


169
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:26.679
In 2005 near the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library in Moorpark, a


170
00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:30.069
stunning example of human tiger conflict
occurred.


171
00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:35.859
It's not a tiger, right there was real,
slow,


172
00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:40.479
huge is about this high up to the fence.
Newly retired George Gross was the


173
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:45.219
incident commander at the California
Fish and Game Department. For more than


174
00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.209
three weeks,


175
00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:49.209
he chased a tiger on the loose in a
residential area.


176
00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:54.699
He got no help from the cat's owner and
on a February morning he had a difficult


177
00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.109
decision to make.


178
00:14:56.110 --> 00:15:02.079
Basically this was like the city living
in fear for a month, because somewhere


179
00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.889
there was this large tiger running
around in their neighbourhood.


180
00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:09.159
We didn't see it for quite a while but
we knew it was in here,


181
00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.759
so when it climbed out it was like it
came out of nowhere all of a sudden.


182
00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:16.779
Everybody could see it and it started
walking around quite slowly through the


183
00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:17.709
grass.


184
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:21.219
You know I was within a hundred fifty
yards of there, first thing I thought was


185
00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:24.789
“What a majestic animal! This thing's
beautiful.” But then you know I came back


186
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:25.839
in as,


187
00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.839
but I have this job.


188
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:47.269
You do too.  So it started walking towards
me and then it started going up a trail and


189
00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:51.169
it sat there and I can't have it up
here on the soccer field, baseball field.


190
00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:53.869
In our opportunity to take a shot


191
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:59.629
really diminishes, so that's when I gave
the order for people with rifles


192
00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:04.489
to. If they had a clean shot, to take the
shot. The male tiger weighs as much as 600


193
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:08.719
pounds was taken from the hills near the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Library by


194
00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.159
wildlife officials, who say they had no
choice but to kill it.


195
00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:19.639
I'm always felt that like unfortunately I
made the right decision and you know to


196
00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:24.019
be honest is the first thing I did was
paddle and say I'm sorry, because


197
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.869
I knew I didn't want to kill him.


198
00:16:30.579 --> 00:16:36.247
George Gross was not the last law
enforcement agent faced with such a


199
00:16:36.249 --> 00:16:37.238
decision,


200
00:16:37.239 --> 00:16:42.488
there was an even more dramatic incident
in October 18 2011 when there was a


201
00:16:42.489 --> 00:16:48.278
massive release of wild animals in Zanesville
Ohio farm. The owner of a private Zoo


202
00:16:48.279 --> 00:16:52.539
threw open the gates of his facility
before committing suicide


203
00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:57.909
This time it wasn't one tiger but 18 on
the loose.


204
00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:03.869
They were all killed by the authorities
along with lions, bears and monkeys.


205
00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:11.939
It probably will come to another tragedy
before certain laws are either in force


206
00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:16.169
like they should be or new laws are
going to have to be implemented to have


207
00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:21.359
multiple situations happen because we're
not moving on these issues is very


208
00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:24.658
tragic and it's very sad not only for
the individuals but the cats that are


209
00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:28.259
involved because most of time those cats
are shot on site.


210
00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:33.459
I'd rather see us being a proactive
mode versus a reactive mode.


211
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:40.879
It’s the time to ban the private ownership
of tigers and other exotic animals.


212
00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:51.369
26 states banned the private ownership
of tigers but in many states


213
00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:58.418
it's still legal to own and breed them if
you have a permit. Stories of tiger cub


214
00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:03.249
sold at swap knees or on the internet
are galvanising the movement to band


215
00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:08.529
private ownership of big cats and in
Washington a political and legal battle


216
00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:09.519
is underway.


217
00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:14.709
People can't believe that these animals
are still being born to be sold as pets


218
00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:19.179
and you can get them for any amount of
money if you’re foolish enough to pay.


219
00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:26.019
And when you see those little Cubs, its
they're cute. But by the time they're


220
00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:30.009
seven months old, they are tearing up
your house and taking a pretty good


221
00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:34.359
chunk out of you because they don't have
a 400-pound mum to say “Nock it off.”


222
00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:41.409
nor do they have any siblings with them
to play. So you become the sibling and


223
00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:44.749
they’re tough.


224
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:47.749
You're dealing with an apex predator.


225
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:52.579
They are top of the food chain, wanted
for the most dangerous animals in the


226
00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:58.609
world and yet our government says that's
ok and they will even give a permit to


227
00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:03.829
have these apex killers and somebody's
backyard


228
00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:10.519
it's very wrong. Tippi Hedren decided
that something needed to be done and


229
00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:15.589
contacted her congressman. She
successfully proposed a new law to


230
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:20.479
prevent taking big cats across state
lines but this was just the beginning.


231
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:25.159
So I took a available to Washington in
2003.


232
00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:32.689
I was simply to stop these animals
moving from one state to another and it


233
00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:36.889
took two years. It was called a title “The
Captive Wildlife Safety Act” was sort of


234
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:42.769
a precursor to the bill that I I am
ultimately, my goal is to have a bill


235
00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:47.509
that would stop the breeding of all of
these animals to be sold as a pet or for


236
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:48.709
financial gain. 


237
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:54.079
Tippi Hedren isn't alone in her quest to
end the private ownership and breeding


238
00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.428
of tigers,


239
00:19:55.430 --> 00:20:00.679
conservation organisations fear that the
captive population of America tigers


240
00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:05.659
could contribute to the lucrative global
trade and tiger parts for traditional


241
00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:06.499
medicines.


242
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:11.059
For now, tiger farms in China
and poaching are the main source of the


243
00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:13.048
parts.


244
00:20:13.049 --> 00:20:18.658
To have a state law and we have 50
states banning breeding of tigers in


245
00:20:18.659 --> 00:20:23.278
captivity would be too problematic and
it's easier to make it a federal


246
00:20:23.279 --> 00:20:26.939
regulation then we don't have 50
different laws that could have as many


247
00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:30.959
different exemptions, so it's easier to
do it at the federal level. The private


248
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:35.428
ban is really focused on going after
the individuals are these backyard


249
00:20:35.429 --> 00:20:40.768
breeders that are sort of out of the
radar. Many private owners who have all


250
00:20:40.769 --> 00:20:47.008
their permits believe they have every
right to keep tigers. While the


251
00:20:47.009 --> 00:20:51.178
possibility of a federal ban would be a
nightmare,


252
00:20:51.809 --> 00:20:56.969
there are more and more and more
restrictions all the time, all the time.


253
00:20:57.509 --> 00:21:01.048
More and more regulations and more and
more restrictions. You


254
00:21:01.049 --> 00:21:06.388
you have to again you have to be
organized, you have to have love it, you


255
00:21:06.389 --> 00:21:09.658
have to present your side of it to the
right people.


256
00:21:09.659 --> 00:21:13.089
It's a political thing, it's a money
thing.


257
00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:17.349
The organisation is pushing for the ban
are also concerned about tiger welfare


258
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:25.299
even federal agencies have set very low
standards of care. A 3 by 3 meter cage is


259
00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.369
the minimum requirement.


260
00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:31.688
Timmy Thies manages the wild cat
sanctuary in Minnesota.


261
00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:38.948
She has heard countless stories of abused
animals and careless owners. Most of the


262
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:42.789
animals including the tigers at the
sanctuary come from people who think a


263
00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:44.439
tiger would make a good pet.


264
00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:48.729
We hear all the stories. They got
aggressive, it turned on me.


265
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:52.269
I can't find vet care, I lost my
homeowner's insurance.


266
00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:56.529
You know I didn't know what get this big.
I did not know it eat this much and we tell


267
00:21:56.530 --> 00:22:00.279
people a wild animal is not a pet and it
never should be kept as one.


268
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:04.839
Tighten behind me that tiger was
illegally owned and should have been


269
00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.668
seized under the state law.


270
00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:11.799
Had he been seized prior to that? His
owner would still be alive today.


271
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:15.819
Stopping people from acquiring and
breeding tigers motivates animal rights


272
00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:19.779
defenders and conservationists but
private readers defend their practice by


273
00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.509
saying that if tigers were to go extinct
in the wild


274
00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:25.809
it would be better to have captive
tigers than none at all. This view is


275
00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:27.459
highly controversial.


276
00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:31.689
My question is “If you been these animals,
we can no longer keep them breed them. So


277
00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:35.169
it will be, they will be extinct in
captivity.”


278
00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:38.229
Now they go extinct in the wild. What have
you accomplished?


279
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:40.839
You killed the species.


280
00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:48.969
A ban on breeding are keeping tigers has
broad implications,


281
00:22:52.269 --> 00:22:56.288
while the United States looks to control
unregulated greeting of tigers by


282
00:22:56.289 --> 00:22:58.808
private owners across the world.


283
00:22:58.809 --> 00:23:02.798
Extraordinary efforts are being made to
save tigers in the wild.


284
00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:11.589
Varane Tilson, zoo tigers represent a
backup for the wild population.


285
00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:16.809
He has been the coordinator of the tiger
species survival plan designed to


286
00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:22.539
maintain healthy and genetically diverse
tigers. In this world we try to have what


287
00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:24.249
we call a hands-off management


288
00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:28.209
that means let's not touch tigers, let's
not play with tigers,


289
00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:32.589
let's consider them really quite
dangerous. For the longest time I refused


290
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:35.079
to even call a tiger by a name.


291
00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:42.009
I'm not particularly fond of house names
and to me they’re numbers. They’re stud


292
00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:49.449
book number and I see a tiger more as a
collection of jeans and what I'm


293
00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:54.579
concerned about is the future way down
the line that these animals still


294
00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:57.798
maintain their tigers.


295
00:23:57.799 --> 00:24:05.538
Scientists have divided tigers in 29
sub-species. Three of them have already


296
00:24:05.539 --> 00:24:07.139
gone extinct.


297
00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:11.609
The Bali tiger in the nineteen forties,
the Caspian tiger in the nineteen


298
00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:14.668
seventies and the Javan tiger in the
nineteen eighties.


299
00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:22.769
Surviving are the Siberian or Amur 
tiger. The Bengal, the Indochinese, the


300
00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:26.609
Malayan and the Sumatran tigers, they are
all endangered


301
00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:31.558
and the last South China tigers can only
be found in captivity.


302
00:24:33.929 --> 00:24:38.969
We know every tiger in the North
American zoos and we know its’ lineage.


303
00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:43.949
We know every parent, grandparent
great-grandparent,


304
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:47.548
great-great-grandparent all the way
back to its wild-caught mother and


305
00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:48.298
father.


306
00:24:48.299 --> 00:24:52.739
So we know exactly where they came from
in Russia for the more Tigers and we


307
00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:56.609
know who they made it with and who their
offspring, so we have these like giant


308
00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:58.829
family trees.


309
00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:07.139
Unlike most zoos, most private owners
don't know the lineage of their tigers


310
00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:10.259
because no one has kept track of their
pedigrees.


311
00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:16.558
Yeah there you go over. Tigers from
different subspecies resemble each other


312
00:25:16.559 --> 00:25:23.939
and most breeders are interested in
keeping subspecies pure. As for


313
00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.229
subspecies,


314
00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:28.619
I I don't believe in them. I don't care


315
00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:35.009
and some of them might have more bangle
blood in them because some of them don't


316
00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:38.308
actually grow that big dick for inventor.


317
00:25:38.309 --> 00:25:41.908
Some of them do, so i know that a lot of
Siberian blood with them.


318
00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:51.569
The white tiger is the best example of
breeding for looks. Loved for its


319
00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:53.129
striking appearance.


320
00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:58.649
It's not a subspecies but a colour morph,
the result of a recessive gene that


321
00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:04.199
causes one in every 10,000 tigers to be
born white. White tigers are almost


322
00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.889
non-existent in the wild but they are
often bred in captivity.


323
00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:13.059
This is made them highly in bred and more
susceptible to health problems and


324
00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:18.039
that's not the only consequence of
private ownership. People notice that many


325
00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:22.658
tigers in captivity might be bigger than
in the wild. As in the wild, you need to stay


326
00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:29.079
athletic to catch prey. In captivity, they
get their food served basically a silver


327
00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:34.418
platter and I know there isn't many
tigers in captivity are huge,


328
00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:38.919
they're simply fat. They are obese, not
good for their liver. Lots of the stuff,


329
00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.409
American tigers are fed.


330
00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:46.359
It's basically start feed, it is from
supermarket. Some of the meat might have


331
00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.978
some hormones in them.


332
00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:52.299
The other territories, somebody might
selectively breed for bigger size


333
00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:56.319
because it looks impressive and display
huge tiger. It looks more impressive than


334
00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:00.459
small tiger. Might be simply because they
just don't exercise as much as the ones


335
00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:07.539
in a wild because any cat you can.
