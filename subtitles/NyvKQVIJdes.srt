1
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.208
In Europe a years ago, did a top 100 list of
things that people want to do when


2
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.348
before they died in England, and do you know
what was number one?


3
00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.069
Swimming with dolphins! Where they have
the opportunity to take photos with our


4
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.729
dolphins,


5
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.539
kisses, handshake, hugs, they get a ride.
from our dolphins. I think it's an


6
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.768
extremely foolish thing to allow people
to do. I don't think it's safe for the


7
00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:46.169
animals, I don't think it's safe for the
people. A lot of people have been injured in


8
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.999
some of the dolphin programs. A lot more
than you think. People really don't


9
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.728
think that visiting area with dolphins
pose any kind of danger because it is


10
00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:07.738
perception is that this is
completely safe environment to which is


11
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.029
probably not.


12
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.509
Dolphins defecate and urinate three
times more, a regular dolphin, three times


13
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.209
more than the average human being every
day.


14
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.308
So this dolphins living its in
its own. People material its own urine


15
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.508
and if you don't do something about that
then with chemicals or with ozone or


16
00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.678
some type of a mitigation, then basically
you get a feathered pit.


17
00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:36.059
The water goes bad so they're
constantly adding chemicals to the water,


18
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.059
chlorine, caustic, soda.


19
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.798
All types of algaecides and polymers and
copper sulfate to make it blue,


20
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.849
but they're constantly finding the fact
that these dolphins are crapping and


21
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.848
peeing in the pool and in large
amounts every day. And we know that most


22
00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.327
of the fecal material which is actually
microbial biomass germs, which are


23
00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.538
dissipating


24
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.279
its water. Education by dolphin there is
about,


25
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.249
I don't know the numbers back, in the
trillions and trillions of bacteria are


26
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:22.059
released. Self cleaning properties for
natural ecosystems but in the enclosed


27
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.889
facility, which you can do you can just
to poul maybe


28
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:36.789
chlorine to the water or try to a filterate
that it is efficient or not efficient


29
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.629
against disease-causing bacteria is
clear. If you were there during the days


30
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.339
of the high concentration, you are at
risk of getting dysentery of getting


31
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.539
skin infections that turn
into a flesh-eating bacterial infection.


32
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.419
There's any number of things that you
you're buying when you buy a ticket to


33
00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.487
these places to put dolphins and whales
and sea lions on public display. Water


34
00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.079
quality can be a issue because what
happens is that the load of the animals


35
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.599
and the technology of changing its like
the ranges can be very extreme, right?


36
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.279
So all is on chlorine, UV. There's all
different parameters,


37
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.918
so some trainers, I've known have
developed like chlorine, rashes.


38
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.338
There is no way to immediately fix some
of these high coliform counts that can


39
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.339
be generated sometimes generated by the
dolphins themselves. Sometimes generated


40
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.259
by the hot water that we you know suffer
through in the summer time when it gets


41
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.249
above 90 degrees down here, there's just
it's a petri dish.


42
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.359
It's not possible to swing without
swallowing.


43
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.959
some water. Some of the bacteria will be
coming really into the gastrointestinal


44
00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:02.449
tract and second treatise. Of course, you
are not protecting your skin as well


45
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.108
right.


46
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.009
This purification system, good question,


47
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:14.869
is it working in a way that immediately
filter the bacteria?


48
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.529
I don't think so maybe some bacteria
even not trapped by the filters so they


49
00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:29.509
actually circulating in that system and
probably become like endogenous


50
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:35.479
population of this aquarium, and maybe when
even without modification, may course some


51
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.289
problems for visitors. There are many in this 
aquarium, any facilities that


52
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.609
have closed circuits filter system, given
amount of water in the tank is


53
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.779
recirculated through the filters, and
then the filters are back washed and


54
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.929
that lowers the water level and
they add fresh water to it out of this


55
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.549
came back clean water. Just a constant
recycle. The water quality conditions


56
00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:02.329
whether it's a natural Lagoon or an
artificial environment, are replete with


57
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:08.539
bacterias viruses and infectious
materials, that if an animal is


58
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.349
compromised because of a wound or
compromised because of poor health or


59
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.609
immune deficiency.


60
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.349
You are basically going to end up with
an animal that needs a lot of medical


61
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.579
attention and it can ultimately die just
from the water quality conditions.


62
00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.099
Medical reports, new crops reports and
marine mammal inventory reports that you


63
00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.179
can find with the National fishery
service that show you that animals have


64
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.009
died from bacterial infections and those
bacterial infections come from the poor


65
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.049
water quality that always exist. What is
actually


66
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:46.288
we happening in these systems, if there
are so big bacterial loop that may pull


67
00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:49.228
the danger for visitors.


68
00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:55.649
If there are some bacteria which are
coming from humans and can infect the


69
00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.538
animals in some studies has been shown
that too.


70
00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:10.049
For example, so call the folk cause
meets the system rays which is


71
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.508
abbreviated MRSA.


72
00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:20.968
It's extremely dangerous because it can
be transferred to my animals, can be


73
00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:26.788
transferred from animals to humans, from
humans to animals and wife sources. Any


74
00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:33.718
infectious diseases that whales and
dolphins in captivity may have, that


75
00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:37.619
could be transferred to a trainer or to
other animals.


76
00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:46.318
The diseases that they get are due to
the stresses. They get pneumonia a lot


77
00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:49.589
from just poor circulation,


78
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:59.638
poor cardiovascular operations. All of
that just slows down in captivity and so


79
00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:06.508
sometimes they get, you don't just common
everyday diseases that usually they're


80
00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:12.448
immune system is able to defeat, but
because they are under such stresses,


81
00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:15.778
their immune system just can't keep up.


82
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.439
Sometimes with that the stresses
they get ulcers.


83
00:07:20.069 --> 00:07:25.198
They get two infections skin
infections. They get a lot of different


84
00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:27.869
kinds of infections. As I came to work


85
00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.909
you know with a common cold and sneezing
and coffin and


86
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:35.679
next thing I know we've got a dolphin or
two that's doing sneezing and coughing.


87
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:41.919
Respiratory ailments that they have to
be put on antibiotics that has happened.


88
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:48.189
Dolphins are highly intelligent and when
they indicated, I think they're


89
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:53.589
subjected to the higher level of stress
probably than than any other animal.


90
00:07:53.590 --> 00:08:01.869
Because the kind of material to brain
and nervous system the a supposedly is


91
00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:07.149
subjected to the higher level of stress.
As we know that stress affects the


92
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:13.149
immune system, it suppresses the immune
system, and to the bacterial load also


93
00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:16.329
changes and colleges changes, it's also
not clear.


94
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:21.759
And so when you are for example swimming
with these animals, you know you'd better


95
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.069
hope they're healthy and that you're
healthy because otherwise it could


96
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:32.438
problems. And certainly trainers have had
problems, and i believe that a few of the


97
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.259
animals that have died in the past die
because they've been exposed to


98
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.848
something from people. Whether it was a
member of the public or trainer,


99
00:08:39.849 --> 00:08:44.199
more likely a trainer. Because the public
generally speaking doesn't interact


100
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:49.569
closely enough and often enough and for
a long enough time with the animals to


101
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:53.679
be a real hazard where a strange course
of their everyday. Diseases the Dolphins


102
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:59.199
get, we can also get. The diseases that we get
we can transfer the dolphins and vice


103
00:08:59.200 --> 00:08:59.829
versa.


104
00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:04.779
There's any number of combinations that
are possible. Diseases that can jump the


105
00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:06.009
species barrier.


106
00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:10.809
Alright so tuberculosis for example, we
can give tuberculosis to marine mammals,


107
00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:15.759
brucellosis brucellosis is a is a
disease of cattle for example. It can


108
00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.939
jump to cetaceans and then it can jump
from stations to humans.


109
00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:24.879
So these are, there are several viruses
and bacteria that can jump from


110
00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.729
citations to people and people to
stations. For moving fiction


111
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:33.138
which probably also can be and in the
various is white,


112
00:09:33.139 --> 00:09:39.049
Bruce for example, a dolphin maybe we can
be also easily infected with this 

113
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:48.528
fungal infections like Candidiasis a
spiritual this type of microbes. Because


114
00:09:48.529 --> 00:09:52.698
i was in the fish house with fish blood
and in and out of salt water with fish


115
00:09:52.699 --> 00:09:54.768
blood and seeing the dolphins.


116
00:09:54.769 --> 00:09:58.909
I got such a bad infection that they
thought that I had leukemia and


117
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:04.669
ultimately had to have a limp snowed in
my left inguinal lymph node removed as a


118
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:07.239
result of that.


119
00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:55.039
In my past, not only have I witnessed
some accidents, I've been the victim of


120
00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.409
some I've had broken ribs.


121
00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:02.989
I have a finger here that looks very
abnormal because of the infection from a


122
00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:04.339
sea lion.


123
00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.989
I've seen people ran and I've seen people
bitten rake marks that just shredded


124
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:10.309
their forearms.


125
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:17.598
If there's any number of
situations that don't always happen in


126
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.929
the wild because the animals get a
chance to choose whether they want to


127
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:21.919
stay or go.


128
00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:27.739
And you won't get hurt if you impose
yourself on these animals. You can


129
00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.789
get hurt just like you do enough with a
dog that doesn't want your attention


130
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:33.949
you're going you're going to get bit.


131
00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:40.249
You do enough to chase or try to go out
and touch a marine mammal who doesn't


132
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:43.039
want to be touched and they will turn on
you.


133
00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:49.429
Usually the effects of captivity are to
make a whale go quite crazy. With what


134
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:56.358
happened with Tilikum he has killed
three people and apparently he would


135
00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:00.679
just went crazy from the effects of
being in captivity because they don't do


136
00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:04.608
that in the wild. At different varying
degrees you get some animals have seen


137
00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:09.379
panic attacks in wales and it's just
like watching a panic attack in human.


138
00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:15.799
It's not nice the psychological effects
of living in captivity causes all sorts


139
00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.579
of stresses. The stress of of sheer
boredom.


140
00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:26.899
For one thing of having nothing around
that would be like us living in a plain


141
00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:33.529
white room with no windows and no
pictures on the wall and no other


142
00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:34.579
company.


143
00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:39.169
Some animals that develop neurotic
characteristics, they rub themselves, they


144
00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:41.359
bang their heads against the wall,


145
00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:46.579
they choose things. In the effects of the
stress of captivity the stress of the


146
00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:50.119
show schedule, the stress of eating dead
fish.


147
00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:55.489
You know it's it's not it's not the diet
these animals are use to having. As it's


148
00:12:55.490 --> 00:13:01.729
the same thing over and over and over
every day the same blaring music and the


149
00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:06.799
same clapping trainers in the same
routines.


150
00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:12.709
There's any number of experiences that
would certainly qualify as aberrant


151
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:18.859
behavior, that in my opinion is caused by
the the stress of captivity. But we give


152
00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:23.149
depressants to the to the petting pool
dolphins because that environment of


153
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:27.709
being stuck with people grabbing at you,
created dolphins that were very


154
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:30.199
aggressive and returned in the biters,


155
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:34.609
and those animals were given depressants
on a regular basis to control their


156
00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:35.419
behavior.


157
00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:39.348
Some animals become aggressive
especially the males, because of their


158
00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:42.859
captive situation. A lot of people and
injured in some of the dolphin programs a


159
00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:44.119
lot more than you think.


160
00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:50.239
There's several reasons why often it's
not reported. One is most people who get


161
00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.149
attacked by dolphin and a swim with a
dolphin program are made to believe it


162
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:54.169
was their fault.


163
00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:57.978
And because they are led to believe that
dolphins are somehow magical happy


164
00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:59.689
creatures that would never hurt a fly.


165
00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:05.029
They believe it, they actually feel that
they must have done something wrong to


166
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:09.169
make that dolphin bite them or make that
dolphin ran them and so they don't


167
00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:10.639
report it because they feel guilty.


168
00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:16.429
So that's one reason why they
don't report it, the other reason is


169
00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:21.468
because the facility itself often
encourages them not to report it, and I


170
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:24.379
believe in a couple of cases they've
actually bought people off,


171
00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:29.089
not too settled you know gave them some
money so they wouldn't report it. But the


172
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:32.119
fact is is that people are injured in
some of the dolphin programs a lot more


173
00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:36.139
than you think it's usually mine are not
saying they're like you know mall or


174
00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:41.809
anything but their bruised
their fractured or broken bones,


175
00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:45.769
they're bitten, they have to get stitches
maybe you know five stitches maybe a


176
00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:46.819
hundred stitches.


177
00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:49.819
You know it happens a lot more often
than you think


178
00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:54.559
safety is guaranteed by the hush money
that is given to pay for whatever injury


179
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:54.949
and


180
00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:58.759
whatever money is made to make sure
those people go out don't go out and


181
00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:04.099
soon if they do sue in many cases, the
it's an out-of-court settlement so


182
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:08.419
nobody can talk about it. There's a gag
order that's put at the end of any


183
00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:10.159
serious injury.


184
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.659
I do know that when it comes to the the
several people who have been injured at


185
00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:21.829
sea world, they many times have settled
out of court and then given an extensive


186
00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:25.969
amount of money in exchange for not
talking about the details of their


187
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:28.939
injury and how this happened and
certainly not having any further


188
00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:33.619
conversation about being injured, so
there's all kinds of ways


189
00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:39.379
you can find yourself in a hospital as a
result of buying a ticket to see these


190
00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:42.379
poor animals as slaves.
