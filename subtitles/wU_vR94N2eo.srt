1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,170
Deep in the remote wilderness of coastal Siberia,

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,980
a phantom walks.

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,100
Known in legend as  Amur, meaning God

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:25,100
and devil.

5
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:31,160
We know it today as the Siberian tiger.

6
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,850
The tiger skirts the edge about our imagination, a symbol of strength

7
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,840
power and beauty.

8
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,820
Yet despite its fierce reputation the Siberian tiger is

9
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,840
dangerously close to extinction.

10
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,320
Less than 400 these great cats remain

11
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,320
in the wild.

12
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,730
Now wildlife biologists are using science

13
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,910
to save the wildest

14
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,380
creatures on earth.

15
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,840
An international team of Russian and American scientists

16
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,980
seeks to better understand the tiger.

17
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,160
Their efforts may be the tigers last best chance

18
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:34,450
as survivor. If the tiger can be saved,

19
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:39,030
it would mean protection for all that exists.

20
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,210
In the Shadow of the Tiger

21
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:01,510
Winters in far eastern Russia long and harsh.

22
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,300
Frigidaire from the heart to the continent

23
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:15,300
rips the land in snow and ice.

24
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,480
By late spring, tropical air of the Sea of Japan

25
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:27,250
warms the land.

26
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,110
Icy winters give way to golden summers

27
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:39,110
and life flourishes

28
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,300
A vast unbroken forest, known

29
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,150
as the Russian Taiga,

30
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,570
blankets much of the region. It is the largest

31
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,820
intact forest in the world

32
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:10,120
and the last stronghold for wild Siberian tigers

33
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,010
Weighting up to 800 pounds, the Siberian tiger is the largest cat

34
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:22,010
in the world nearly twice the size of an adult lion.

35
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:27,220
Born of snow and ice, the Siberian tiger can sprint through the forest

36
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,450
at fifty miles an hour.

37
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,350
It has thrived in this remote wilderness for thousands of years

38
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:40,210
surviving on instinct and finely honed behavior.

39
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,630
The Siberian tiger once numbered in the thousands

40
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,980
ranging from eastern Russia to South Korea,

41
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,690
but poaching and habitat destruction are taking their toll.

42
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,960
Today less than 400 Siberian tigers exist in the wild

43
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:05,100
Anf these are found almost exclusively along the narrow band of mountains and coastal

44
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,130
Siberia.

45
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,150
The Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve

46
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:16,150
lies at the heart of Tiger country.

47
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,710
It is the largest wildlife sanctuary in the Russian Far East,

48
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,070
encompassing more than a thousand square miles,

49
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:31,070
a forested mountain, clear rivers and unbroken coastline.

50
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:43,380
At the edge of a forest glade, roe deer

51
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,310
graces. They remain alert, knowing that

52
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:54,280
out there moving silently through the forest

53
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:00,640
a cat is on the prowl.

54
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:05,670
It is a tigress seeking out for prey.

55
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,370
She will not make it killed today

56
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:27,370
but must soon as she has another mouth to feed.

57
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,670
This six month old tiger cub

58
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,030
its name Larisha, her mother Katia.

59
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,740
They are part of an in-depth study into the secretive life of Siberian tigers.

60
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,000
Linda Curley and John Goodrich are a husband and wife research team

61
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,280
coordinating the efforts at the Siberian tiger project,

62
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:04,280
a joint Russian-American study conducted by the Hornocker Wildlife Institute.

63
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,630
Based on the University of Idaho,

64
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,940
the Hornocker Institute studies threatened and endangered species around

65
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,820
the world.

66
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:18,900
For John and Linda, studying in tigers in Russia's remote wilderness

67
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:23,040
is the opportunity of lifetime. It baffles me that

68
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:28,110
There's actually man that exists in orange with black stripes, so

69
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,880
first to order,

70
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,020
they're beautiful. We'll get to see her very often when we do get to go inside...

71
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:40,000
makes her job everything worthwhile... you know this everything worthwhile.

72
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,830
I think we have a wonderful opportunity to protect tigers, to conserve tigers

73
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,790
and it's really exciting to be here,

74
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:52,710
a part of that and hopefully contribute to that.

75
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,870
I love the world, I love the world on the scene the more wild it is.

76
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,010
The better it is I want my favorite place in the whole world is hunting the

77
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,470
beach.

78
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:03,630
We're more likely to see a tiger track on the beach

79
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:08,370
than a human footprint.

80
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,830
When I get out on the course to have a backpack or I'm

81
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,750
out for weeks at a time. I'm doing what I love to me it's just as

82
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,570
much like occasions. It is

83
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,650
like work.

84
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,760
The thing that I love about ecobiology is learning

85
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,430
how other species besides humans

86
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:30,060
interact with each other xxx and

87
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,590
just how they make a living and I like seeing it firsthand

88
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:41,570
like being in field.

89
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,240
John and Linda rarely see the animals they study.

90
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:48,490
Tigers are secretive animals and you just can't... you can't just sit around

91
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,540
and watch them, so we have to use radio telemetry in order to answer some of

92
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,690
these questions and these questions are critical

93
00:07:54,690 --> 00:08:00,510
to server in tiger conservation. John and Linda are using radio telemetry

94
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:06,990
unlock the Siberian tigers elusive nature. Scientists are now able to

95
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,690
determine

96
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,900
the tiger's home range size,

97
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:16,420
eating habits and social structure.

98
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,480
Little by little, a picture of tiger society

99
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:26,480
is a merger.

100
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,890
In order to use radio telemetry,

101
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,580
the scientists must first get a collar on the tiger.

102
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:39,530
To capture a new tiger, the scientists use thick

103
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:45,380
cabled snares. They place the snares along trails frequently used by adult

104
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,060
tigers.

105
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:51,040
The thick cables are ideal allowing the scientists to capture a tiger

106
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:59,710
without injuring. Snare was over the spring like that tell your clients will step on the striker.

107
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,310
Then the

108
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:09,220
cables attached to the tree and everything will be covered up.

109
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,610
Several snares have been set they will be checked daily.

110
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:17,430
Now

111
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,440
it's a waiting game.

112
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,180
Weeks can go by without a capture.

113
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,580
Joining the team is Russian biologist Eager Nikolai Viji.

114
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:32,350
Eager probably knows more about Siberian tigers than anyone.

115
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,790
He's been studying the great cat for more than 30 years.

116
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,060
Luck is on their side.

117
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:44,370
Only days after the snares are set, tiger

118
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,990
has captured. Our biggest concern is the safety of the animal.

119
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,320
As the animal somehow been hurt by this snare, something happened to, it

120
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:57,500
is very agitated. We stopped about 50 yards away from her.

121
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:01,210
Wad the darts into the gun.

122
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,690
and then approached slowly and quietly.

123
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,980
The first approach is the most dangerous because the scientists have no way of

124
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,480
telling how securely

125
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:20,470
the tiger is held in the snare. Yeah it's dangerous.

126
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,600
She was probably more agitated then you xxx xxx.

127
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,940
Gardiner and I backed to let that dart take effect because I knew even if it

128
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:59,550
wasn't enough it will calm down again and indeed it did in the second time

129
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,450
when she was much less mobile and and much easier to work with.

130
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:07,640
Any capture whether the tigers agitator or not,

131
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:11,600
we try to avoid eye contact, try not to approach too closely.

132
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:15,500
Stay in a little bit of cover if we can and in general try not to

133
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:22,500
present ourselves in a threatening or dominant way.

134
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:52,330
The tiger was unharmed during the capture. The team must work quickly

135
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:58,400
before the drugs wear off. Tigers

136
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:02,690
have no blank response when sedated so their eyes must be artificially

137
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,880
lubricated

138
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:10,880
and covered.

139
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,560
We start to put

140
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,650
fixed radio cymru which could get a radio collar as quickly as possible.

141
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:26,290
The new radio collar tier will provide the scientists with crucial information

142
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,800
on tiger behavior.

143
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:35,430
Ear tags are also attached

144
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,000
to identify the tiger in case the radio collar falls off.

145
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,780
We're really interested in body measurements of all kinds

146
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:47,320
and gives us a lot of information about body condition, about growth rates in animals

147
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,330
and differences between male and female

148
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,690
body parameters. When we take pad measurements

149
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,950
particularly the pad with because we've

150
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,940
also measure tracks using track measurements can help us to identify

151
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:08,030
individuals. Tiger paws

152
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,670
are thickly padded, allowing it to move quickly over snow

153
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,890
and ice. Their claws are retractable keeping them sharp

154
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,670
for gripping pray.

155
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:35,660
She's moving.

156
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:42,600
The tiger is showing signs that the drugs are wearing off.

157
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,860
The decision is made to abandon collecting more information

158
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:51,220
and move out as quickly as possible. We have radio collars on

159
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:56,050
nine president tigers and that represents just a small portion

160
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:00,180
of the entire population of Siberia tigers, but those nine animals

161
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:04,570
have radio collars will tell us so much about the population that we feel that

162
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,930
disturbing those nine animals will be worth the long route to protect the population as a

163
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:15,930
whole.

164
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:25,570
Tigers are not alone in this wideness. The village of Tenei

165
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:30,640
lies at the edge of the reserve.

166
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:36,360
The people here have lived with Tigers for generations.

167
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,150
Although Siberian tigers are not known

168
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,760
as man-eaters, precautions  are taken. Cattle

169
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:53,380
are herd at home in the evening and dogs stand guard

170
00:14:53,390 --> 00:15:00,200
outside homes.

171
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:03,180
It is not unheard of a wounded or sick tiger

172
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:09,420
to wander into town looking for an easy meal.

173
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,960
However Siberian tigers prefer to stay deep in the forest

174
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:23,640
where they blend seamlessly into the landscape.

175
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:55,870
All life in the Russian Far East at here to nature's own timetable

176
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:08,780
what may start out as a few innocent flakes can turn serious

177
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:13,220
in a matter of minutes.

178
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:38,170
The Siberian tiger

179
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:43,150
was unmistakably the top predator of the Russian Far East

180
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,760
and for centuries it thrived here insecure

181
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:51,690
isolation.

182
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,080
Those days are gone

183
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,630
the modern world has cut its way through these ancient forests.

184
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,120
Logging is shrinking the Siberian tigers habitat.

185
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:06,830
The roads that logging creates leaves the tigers vulnerable to speeding cars

186
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:10,520
and poachers. Katya and Larissa

187
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,980
face this thread every day.

188
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:19,980
Their home ranges is bisect by the area's busiest road.

189
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:27,100
The pair must frequently cross this road while hunting.

190
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,870
John and Linda are concerned about Katya.

191
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,060
They say she is often too bold to close to the road,

192
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:44,450
other Tigers are more wary. Eleven centimeters hunt foot.

193
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,230
Okay so it is walking on the road down there,

194
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,440
probably a car came,

195
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,460
he ran up the back came around here

196
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:57,860
and then duck down behind the tree, so you can see where

197
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,010
front feet were here and that his hind leg was Ktya

198
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,470
out to the side right here his tail

199
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,270
stretches around right back here.

200
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,010
Probably car came, he hopped up here in duct and hide

201
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,600
watch the car goes by and then went back down and walked up the roof.

202
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:21,950
It is difficult for a tiger to learn the dangers of roads.

203
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,870
Its first encounter with a car or a poacher.

204
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:31,410
It is often its last. This tiger was killed

205
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:35,130
close to the road. The poachers skin the cat

206
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,680
but left its bones behind.

207
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:41,080
Perhaps unaware of their value,

208
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:45,000
the skeleton along is worth more than a year's wages

209
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:48,780
for local family. A tempting proposition for a people

210
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:52,590
in such dire economic need.

211
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,900
Tiger bones are highly valued on the Asian medicine market

212
00:18:55,910 --> 00:19:00,640
for their ancient curative powers. This belief

213
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,710
as push the Siberian tiger to the brink

214
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,480
of extinction.

215
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:13,810
To combat the illegal trade in wildlife, anti-poaching patrols have been launched

216
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:18,490
across the region. Checkpoints are set up to look for poachers

217
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:25,120
transporting illegal wildlife. Anatolia Tavia, a

218
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,160
director of the Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve

219
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:31,180
accompanies his man on patrol.

220
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:34,940
Setting up roadblocks and checking vehicles

221
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,720
is a good measure of potion prevention. If you discover a poacher,

222
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:43,360
we confiscate his preys and his gun.

223
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:47,310
It is also effective because the widely announced our intention to check certain

224
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,780
roles in certain day.

225
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:51,870
So many poachers who would have come here

226
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,060
you know. Of course poachers are still hard to reserve

227
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:59,540
but they are not as normal as they once were.

228
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:03,100
Still this is not a typical job.

229
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:06,860
The man works 24-hour shape, it is difficult

230
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:11,750
and intense more. The patrols dedication is paying off.

231
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,680
Poaching on the reserve is down by forty percent

232
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:21,760
but they must be ever vigilant. As long as a market for tiger bones exists,

233
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:28,760
poaching will remain a serious threat.

234
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,860
John Linda and field assistant Kohler Even

235
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:43,880
are traveling to Kayta's home range. Once they find her tracks

236
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:47,040
they will spend days covering large areas

237
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:54,040
following Kayta's movement.

238
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,420
For the next several days, this cabin will serve as base camp.

239
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,750
The team will head out early tomorrow morning

240
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:20,750
to look for Kayta's tracks.

241
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:37,980
We know

242
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:41,500
from radio telemetry where tiger has been

243
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,980
but then when the tiger leaves we have to go in there and try to figure out

244
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:49,100
where the tiger did and we do that by following their tracks are looking for

245
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:56,100
any other sign that they've left behind.

246
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:02,970
Being a field biologists and studying tigers in particular

247
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,980
is a lot like doing detective work.

248
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:09,550
Some blood indefinitely

249
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,910
welcome possibly secret.

250
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,850
Siberian tigers primarily feed

251
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,440
on wild boar deer and elk.

252
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:23,830
Tigers will often drive whatever they killed.

253
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,520
A short distance and often it's into

254
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:31,260
central distance cover. One of the interesting things we're trying to look

255
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,390
at right now is how much

256
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,470
tiger eats when it has not been disturbed by humans

257
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,310
how much they eat when they has been disturbed by human. You can see here that is

258
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,260
only in about sixty percent of this elk. Usually tigers

259
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:48,380
eat everything you come into a killing all you'll find is the lower legs

260
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:52,140
for lower legs and the

261
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:55,570
remains the head which is often completely chewed up.

262
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:59,330
A drawing some broken bones lying there he didn't finish this one because he

263
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,230
killed it very close to the road in its laying here maybe

264
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,080
150 meters from the road . So he got spooked by all the activity on the road

265
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,390
and left a lot of meat.

266
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,750
behind. They rely on

267
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,760
on stealth to capture their prey. They are

268
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:20,960
hunting technique is a stock, a short rush and they jump on the animal once they

269
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:23,530
get on animal they almost always kill it.

270
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:29,470
To survive tigers must consume 12 to 15 pounds of meat a day.

271
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:35,690
They hunt from dusk till dawn.

272
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,640
Keen eyesight, large cannons

273
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:42,020
sharp claws and the massive

274
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:46,750
battering ram like body enable the tiger to bring down prey

275
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:52,700
much larger than itself. Katya easily takes down five hundred-pound

276
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:53,750
wild boar.

277
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:59,140
That's nearly twice her own weight.

278
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:02,840
Much of the killing is done with her teeth.

279
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:05,860
All can see that both for lower canines were broken up

280
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:09,050
the gums. Kayta's teeth are characteristic of

281
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:12,330
much older tiger. By examining tooth photos

282
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:16,210
scientists are able to judge the approximate age of a tiger.

283
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:20,770
incisors crook. While I am out and tracking a tiger

284
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:25,330
I am just constantly visualizing what the tiger is doing.

285
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,850
Sometimes to the point where even kind of increasing my heartbeat and I start

286
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,130
getting really excited about it.

287
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,400
And of course added to that is

288
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:38,310
always the chance that there's going to be a tiger just around the corner.

289
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,350
and that there's going to be some kind of encounter just makes it

290
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:51,480
where within Katya's territory.

291
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:56,050
Measuring the print

292
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,120
confirms these are Kayta's tracks.

293
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:07,500
Another much smaller set of tracks indicates Kayta is traveling with her

294
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,940
six-month-old daughter

295
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:11,980
Larissa.

296
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:18,980
First Tiger here.

297
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,630
See if there's any other kind.

298
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,220
John and Linda have tracked Kayta for the past

299
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:28,870
three years. She has become their favorite. That's no small animal.

300
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,160
It marks like that track. The scientists were

301
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,620
even lucky enough to catch a rare glimpse of Katya.

302
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:44,310
The two of them play together and the cutoff initiated. The thing that

303
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,530
really surprise me

304
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:50,560
was Katya also would initiate to play and it was amazing for us to see that

305
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:55,120
the mother would be just as play for us as the couplets.

306
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,510
The interactions between Katya and Larissa

307
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:02,340
are important in understanding how mothers raise their young.

308
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,420
The time exclude their mothers

309
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:12,410
Most of their social skills that they will need for the rest life.

310
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:15,330
Because the rest so I spent

311
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:22,330
was a solitary not the company of tigers

312
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,410
Larissa is old enough to share kills with her mother

313
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:35,380
but still too young to hunt. She will stay with her mother for at least

314
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,440
another year

315
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:40,070
until she can survive on her own.

316
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:44,590
Before Katya was ready to breed, she first established a home range

317
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:48,070
or territory and spent time getting to know

318
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:52,450
her mate. Males will get together with females not just for purposes or agreement,

319
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,230
sometimes

320
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:56,960
will share kills and there's probably some importance

321
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,810
in those relationships and a male and a female knowing each other before they were

322
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:07,890
read with each other.

323
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:13,530
Katya regularly patrols more than 270 square miles

324
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:20,530
encompassing frozen lakes and weather coastline.

325
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:21,910
The female will

326
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,960
orient for territory based on where the food resources are,

327
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:29,080
where the the beer and the elk are.

328
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:34,850
And a male often overland his territory on one or more females.

329
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:38,760
Siberian tigers have the largest home range

330
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:43,660
then any tiger subspecies. A single male territory

331
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:46,850
can encompass more than six hundred square miles.

332
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,970
It's phenomenal that they can still

333
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,760
patrol their entire home range and keep other individuals

334
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:57,610
out of their territories. The fact that they are territorial at all and can

335
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:02,150
maintain exclusive home ranges is pretty amazing. Tigers will violate

336
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,190
and challenge territories and sometimes that can result in

337
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,840
fights and really aggressive encounters. Katya spots a intruder.

338
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:13,960
It is an unfamiliar tiger.

339
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:41,140
The encounter is brief and largely a display of dominance.

340
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:44,140
No one is injured. Katya

341
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:47,900
is lucky this time these encounters can be fatal.

342
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:51,700
Larissa

343
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:56,320
unaware of the danger. It is just as playful as ever happy to have her mother back.

344
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,820
Communication among tigers

345
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:09,090
is another area of great interest to John and Linda. Soon as we might think of

346
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,460
solitary animals is not communicating with each other.

347
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:16,060
But when they do communicate it is really important. The main form of communication

348
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,540
among tigers

349
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:21,470
is through scent-marking. They go around and the urinate on trees and sometimes

350
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:21,870
they

351
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,610
do this very frequently. Just as part of their daily activity.

352
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:35,780
This is a traditional tiger marked tree

353
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:40,110
where tiger out of xxx walk down the road here came up to the tree

354
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,350
turn around and spray the tree with urine. You can see this

355
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,540
dark spot right here where it is marked and then by this track that looks like he

356
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,070
also

357
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,720
came up in and probably scratched a little bit like this and kind of hug a

358
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:52,330
tree and

359
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:58,100
rubbed his side of his face against it. Katya uses scent marks

360
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:02,130
to advertise our presence and to mark the boundaries of her territory.

361
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:07,280
Through her scent mark, another tiger can determine Katya's age,

362
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:11,820
sex and identity. A male tiger can even tell

363
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:18,150
if she's ready to breed. This large male is responding to assent

364
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:24,100
Katya recently left. Known as flaming behavior

365
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:28,320
it is normally displayed at sites where other tigers have sprayed their scent.

366
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:32,270
This contortion

367
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,490
allows the smell to reach a cent organ at the back

368
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:44,800
of the tiger's mouth. Climbing trees maybe just a former exercise for Katya,

369
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:48,970
but sweat glands in her paws leave behind a cent.

370
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:03,710
Even affectionate displays between Katya and Larissa

371
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,890
are partly sent oriented. Rubbing

372
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:11,760
transfers and mixes body sense between familiar cats,

373
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,110
reinforcing and maintaining social bonds.

374
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:22,110
Katya and Larissa are providing valuable insight into tiger society.

375
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:28,160
It is time to move on but John and Linda

376
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:33,310
will return to Katya's home and continue searching for answers to the tiger's

377
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:38,340
survive.

378
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:42,700
Today the scientists will attempt a helicopter capture of a tiger named

379
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:48,230
Natashaa. The batteries on her radio collar need to be replaced

380
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,710
if they fail in their efforts valuable study animal will be forever

381
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,390
lost. Biologist Bark Liar

382
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:02,650
joins the team in this crucial effort.

383
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:05,980
Bbefore the capture before we take off

384
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:12,980
I'm just incredibly tense nervous and I think everybody is.

385
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:25,510
Once we get into the air the feeling is still very tense

386
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:29,080
but we all become so focused on what we're doing.

387
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:36,080
In general I lose my fear and a lot of my apprehension.

388
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:41,610
First thing we do is we've of course we fly to that animal's home range

389
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:45,920
and were searching for the signal. To get the signal

390
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:49,640
one hone in that animals as quickly as possible.

391
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:52,810
So everybody on the helicopter really

392
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:57,220
were cooperating just trying to get the first visual on the animal.

393
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:04,800
It's very important that the first person that sees the tiger communicates

394
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,040
that to someone who can

395
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,850
communicate to the pilots because the pilots are the ones that have to see the

396
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:18,610
tiger right away because they are certain one to xxx.

397
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:39,810
There is definitely danger involved because you're working

398
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:43,900
at such close quarters to the tops of trees

399
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:48,560
from air there's a very small cue gotten

400
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:52,740
and especially from the air because you're looking down on the back of them.

401
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:55,840
And with the animal moving in the tree,there's

402
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:59,600
usually not a big period time that you can take a

403
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:02,760
shot at you be a little narrow time frame that you can

404
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:09,760
take a shot at animal. That's usually when they stopped.

405
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:32,700
A dart doesn't fly like a bullet, a dart is affected by gravity and it's also

406
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,680
affected by

407
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:37,070
prop wash and the it flies more like an arrow.

408
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:53,270
This capture was a little more difficult then some other captures

409
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,100
because

410
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:58,800
Natasha was in the river bottom where the trees are really tall so we couldn't get

411
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,210
down as close to her

412
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,450
just we would like to. They are not really afraid

413
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:06,490
this helicopter this monster and it's a big helicopter

414
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,060
and this monster in the sky following them. They are not afraid of it.

415
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,170
They are just mad

416
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:15,120
and there would be perfectly willing to just try and pull that thing out of

417
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:15,640
the sky

418
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:19,200
if only they can reach it.

419
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:22,740
So you can get started anyway a little bit and see what kind of effect it has because

420
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,360
it takes

421
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:26,990
five to ten minutes for ketamine to have an effect on the

422
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,290
on the animal.

423
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,940
Our biggest concern is the animal is done. Since it looks like a stone, we

424
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:39,040
got on the ground as quickly as possible.

425
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:45,460
At that point when the animal is on the ground, every minutes is crucial.

426
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:49,740
You can't get to the and more as quick as you want. To make sure their

427
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,750
breathing is stabilized and also

428
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:57,410
when you are approaching an animal they're not held by a snare so there's the

429
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,110
possibility that the animal

430
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:06,110
will come for you.

431
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:14,560
We all share in making sure that we're monitoring respiration all the time.

432
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,730
Surprise,

433
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:36,780
her teeth are pretty good.

434
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:50,600
The blood and tissue samples are really important because we use them

435
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,300
to do genetic analysis. The information we have on

436
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:58,250
genetic analysis to compare how different Siberian tigers are from other

437
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,290
subspecies.

438
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:06,290
We've got to get

439
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,060
that really a color change so we want to make sure that the capture successful

440
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:11,630
but we

441
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,270
were always worried about the animal safety. That's number one.

442
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:26,220
Yeah we've been going on,

443
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:32,180
on the forest on some of the adults.

444
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:41,020
Okay we have got a tooth wear right now.

445
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:44,310
Well, we age tigers by their tooth and by tooth wear.

446
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,480
But having for us to have

447
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:51,370
photographs tooth we can then compare all our different tigers

448
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:54,400
at the same time.

449
00:37:54,410 --> 00:38:01,400
We like to leave a tiger that's showing

450
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:05,400
some signs of getting up.

451
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:11,830
Once they start to show a little bit of head movement,

452
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:15,720
it is still going to be usually another 10 to 15 minutes before they can

453
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:20,000
really you know get up and and walk away or something at least I want.

454
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:27,000
Which is getting up. She is getting up.

455
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:38,040
OK, let's pick up quick. It's really important to get these animals

456
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:40,660
radio collar because tigers are very secretive you can

457
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:44,440
go out and sit down and watch them. With tigers you can't do that you almost

458
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:51,440
never see them.

459
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,120
The

460
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:58,510
information that we are getting is real important for

461
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:02,910
putting together a conservation plan. It actually could save this

462
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:08,090
the species.

463
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:36,080
When we started

464
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:39,410
our research program here in 1992 our goal

465
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:43,130
was not simply to study tigers but have a better understanding of them from a

466
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,240
scientific perspective.

467
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:48,730
It was to develop the best database possible for the implementation have a

468
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:51,510
conservation plans for the Siberian tiger.

469
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,550
Director of the Siberian tiger project Dale Migul

470
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,800
briefs John and Linda on the latest updates to the conservation plan. Acted

471
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:03,160
in one system of protected areas that will provide

472
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:06,660
a continuous expansive tiger habitat from the north.

473
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:11,890
Northern limits the range to very southern. It is a bold plan

474
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,520
ranking national parks and reserves together

475
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:19,630
to form quarter that provides absolute security

476
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:26,140
for the tiger and its prey.

477
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:29,740
Siberian tigers require an enormous amount of space.

478
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:34,220
Setting aside land for the entire population would be impossible.

479
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:37,950
Tigers and people must share the land.

480
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:43,500
Tiger conservation is not just said inside land but it's actually finding

481
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,940
ways for people to live

482
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:49,740
in harmony or causes coexist tigers. It means use all the resources the natural

483
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:53,410
resources in a way that does not damage them.

484
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:59,570
They works with community members to implement tiger conservation

485
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:03,300
on the local level.

486
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:07,510
The survival of tigers

487
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,940
and conservation general is very closely linked to

488
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:17,450
the well-being of people. If people feel they are a sense of well-being that their

489
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:21,730
economic need to be met that I can return to the fourth resources

490
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,960
and extract them

491
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:29,480
in such an intense a fashion as when they feel they're being stressed. Conservation.

492
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:30,400
will succeed

493
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:35,010
only if the people of the region see the tiger as a creature worth saving.

494
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,780
It is late autumn of Russian Far East.

495
00:41:55,790 --> 00:42:02,100
Time of change.

496
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:05,840
One year has come and gone since the scientists first saw

497
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:09,340
Katya and the Larissa in the wild.

498
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:13,330
Larissa is now an adult tigress. She has stayed close to home

499
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:16,890
taking over part of Kayta's territory.

500
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:22,350
Like her mother, Larissa has marked the boundaries of her range.

501
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:26,840
She has even found a mate, a radio collared tiger

502
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,580
named Jenny.

503
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:36,220
Tigers can live in jungles. Tigers can live in swampland. Tigers can live

504
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,320
in arboreal forest.

505
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:41,740
Border is critical where those arguments xxx.

506
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:47,160
So when we ask how do we save tigers how do we save tiger habitat we're really asking

507
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:52,710
how do we save habitat for the XXX on which tiger survive.

508
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,310
Wild boar make up more than fifty percent of the tigers diet

509
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,240
or feed on Korean pine nuts

510
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:07,240
which are abundant in the dense forest  of Sikhote-Alin.

511
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,380
Korean pine is also a highly value timber source.

512
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:16,790
Large numbers of these trees have been cut from the tiger and although now

513
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,630
protected

514
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:24,630
illegal logging of Korean pine continues to this day.

515
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:32,700
Dale in Russian biologists Sasha Mutual Inc are trying to determine what the

516
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:33,880
tiger's pray

517
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:37,090
needs to survive.

518
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:40,400
You have a good answer on tiger biology, means understanding the relationship between

519
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:43,940
tigers the animals that also occur in the forest.

520
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:46,960
Their relationship between dear know

521
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:49,970
wild boar and bear.

522
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:54,410
Understanding that a more complex is a first step to understanding

523
00:43:54,420 --> 00:44:00,000
what tigers needed to survive. Biologists with the Hornocker Wildlife Institute

524
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:03,340
hope to paint a complete picture tiger ecology.

525
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:08,450
The long-term survival of wild Siberian tigers

526
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:15,450
is dependent on the success of countless plants and animals.

527
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:23,860
Larissa's mate Jenny has spent the last three days in one area.

528
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:30,700
He moved on early this morning. Linda and Cola are going in to investigate

529
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:35,770
what Jenny left behind.

530
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:52,190
The two researchers expect to find the remains of the tiger's kill.

531
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:56,520
What they discover shocks them both.

532
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,510
When we first walked into that kill side of course we're expecting to

533
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:23,270
find an elk or bore, the usual food item of a tiger.

534
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,450
Who was pretty shocking when we look down inside

535
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:31,710
tiger paws.

536
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:43,510
The researchers must now determine the identity of the

537
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,060
tiger

538
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:47,190
and how it died. Linda fears

539
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:51,020
the dead tiger is Larissa.

540
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:55,500
With multiple blood here on her nose was like she come off the kill.

541
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:59,870
Maybe bone was broken. Four ribs broken.

542
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:15,390
We were looking at her claws because they were black

543
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:19,470
and they were eroded at me and as if she had been drugged

544
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:24,580
on the asphalt. Coal and Linda are confused by their findings,

545
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:27,840
broken bones, ripped flash, tar

546
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:31,500
In the fur a tiger did not kill this animal.

547
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:34,680
Right now I suspect that this is Katya Katya's

548
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:38,460
twenty-month-old cobe who's been on our own for the last

549
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:41,610
several months not traveling with Katya

550
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:46,920
which is a bit confusing right now because we know that they've also spent time

551
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:47,600
together.

552
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:53,090
This cub and Jenny they've shared kills we suspected that they made it so I'm

553
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:53,740
not sure

554
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:58,840
what's going on but we need to do a search the area more

555
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:03,520
seeking to find a few more bones, seeking to find some more tracks.

556
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:08,680
You try to piece the puzzle together, we work with this animal every day

557
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:12,380
that's our job is to track these animals become like part of our family

558
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:16,010
and we know so much about him though we rarely see them.

559
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:19,610
All over radio collared tigers are like

560
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:24,740
individuals to us and so when something happens to one of them.

561
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:27,930
It becomes a very a personal thing.

562
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:32,130
and personal loss.

563
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:35,770
The dead tiger is Larissa, Kayta's

564
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:40,190
only daughter. The young tigress John and Linda knew so well

565
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:45,170
is dead.

566
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:46,140
We knew exactly

567
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:49,480
when the cub was conceived. We knew exactly when the cub born.

568
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:53,560
Although we never had a radio collar on the cub we followed it through

569
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:56,720
the first two years. So it is like from

570
00:47:56,730 --> 00:48:00,500
was still traveling with Katya and after that kept calling it through

571
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:04,620
tracking in the snow. So we're losing this cub

572
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:08,520
losing alive information.

573
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:12,300
Linda and Cola investigation leads them to the road,

574
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:17,190
we determined that the animal was hit by a car, actually hit by a large truck

575
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:21,790
the tracks start here. It's like the hitter and drug her

576
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:27,820
under the back tires all the way to here. That's about 15 meters.

577
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:32,320
The driver then picked up Larissa's

578
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:32,880
limp

579
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:36,880
bloody body, dragged her to the side of the road

580
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:40,710
and threw her down the gully.

581
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,230
Larissa's mate Jenny found the young tigress.

582
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:48,500
Tracks show that he carried her more than 200 yards,

583
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:52,900
an incredible distance to a clearing in the forest.

584
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:55,880
Jenny stayed with the Larissa for three days

585
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:59,290
before leaving. The fact that

586
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:03,690
the animal died a senseless death because somebody was driving too fast

587
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,820
on the road. That makes me angry.

588
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:12,910
This is the only road through the reserve and it goes right through the

589
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:13,360
middle

590
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:17,960
of one of the most productive home ranges reserve. But because

591
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:18,840
of this road

592
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:23,110
every single tiger that has been born in this area for at least the last eight

593
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:23,860
years

594
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:27,760
has died as a result either being hit by cars

595
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:32,540
or being shot by poachers from the road.

596
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:39,370
There are times like this when the future of wild Siberian tigers

597
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:43,990
seems lost. Yet in Siberia it is said

598
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,070
hope this is last to die despite all odds

599
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:52,730
the number of wild Siberian tigers is on the rise

600
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:56,350
from a low 250 in 1992

601
00:49:56,350 --> 00:50:01,920
to an estimated 350 today.

602
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:06,550
The tiger especially the Siberian tiger is perhaps the ultimate symbol

603
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:11,230
wildness the ultimate symbol of perhaps are linked to nature.

604
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:14,570
Everybody is enamored

605
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:18,700
or afraid or some way has some kind of relationship to attack whether the

606
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:21,110
they'd seen one in the wild if they live with their tigers or not

607
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:24,670
Children know about tigers won the first animal they learn about.

608
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:28,010
He is retiring if we can't save an animal with that strong

609
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:31,960
cultural symbol not only for Russia for the whole world, it comes

610
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:35,980
down to ask a question whether we would save ourselves so we need to save

611
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:36,690
the tiger.

612
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,290
As much for its own sake it's for our own.

613
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:43,650
Their beauty was the treasure, a jewel on this earth

614
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:46,860
that we should protect. I can't image life on this earth

615
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:53,860
without other creatures so exquisitely.

616
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:57,250
It's clear an opportunity exists

617
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:01,890
to save Russia's greatest treasure not just in myth and legend

618
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:07,460
but as it has lived for centuries stalking the snowy peaks and river

619
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:08,130
valleys

620
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:11,630
of the Russian Far East, a place

621
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:15,460
and the people that live in the shadow

622
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:16,570
of the time.
