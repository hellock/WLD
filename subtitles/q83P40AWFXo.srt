1
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.679
the Koala is one of Australia‘s most loved
animals，


2
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.029
with his big fluffy ears and black buttoned
nose, it‘s adored by all.


3
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.779
Though cute, koalas are thought to be lazy
and slow on the uptake,


4
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.658
but once you scratch the surface there's
much more to their world


5
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:30.048
than meets the eye.


6
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.829
Communication, conflict, and even
deception


7
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.577
occur inside the usually secret world
of koala colony.


8
00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.418
With that world becoming ever more
fragmented from urban encroachment,


9
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.889
it's a society that is now under threat.


10
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.217
Two hundred years ago millions of koalas
leave across Australia's eucalypts forests.


11
00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:59.529
Today, an estimated 50,000 remain.


12
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.268
There's a turf war going on and the
koalas


13
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:10.709
are losing.


14
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.139
But as we moving on the territory can koalas
continue to live their


15
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:30.597
slow life in the fast lane?


16
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.738
Brisbane is a rapidly expanding city.


17
00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.598
It's home to two million people with
nearly 1,000 more


18
00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:48.268
moving here every week. 


19
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.389
But in the outskirts of this
sub-tropical City


20
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.208
are some of the best eucalypt forests in
Australia.


21
00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:02.039
These provide refuge to countless animal
spaces.


22
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.988
People are the newcomers here and I am
competing with animals


23
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.259
for the same real estate. 


24
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:27.588
On a typical Brisbane morning in July
residents go about their daily business.


25
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.859
But the locals are unaware that a silent
witness


26
00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:40.419
shares the suburbs.


27
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.648
A female koala has also made this
neighborhood her home.


28
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:54.059
This is the boundary where the world of
people and koalas collide.


29
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.039
Inside the small urban pockets of forests
koala society can be a place


30
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.358
of high drama.


31
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.179
For a female 


32
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.549
in the suburbs the attention from male koalas
can be exhausting because they're


33
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.958
after one thing,


34
00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:21.238
sex.


35
00:04:21.238 --> 00:04:22.017
The female


36
00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.038
is not interested and does her best to
reject the young upstart.


37
00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:29.279
When the


38
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.959
alpha male sees her messing around with
the rival, there's a trouble.


39
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.569
Weighing a burly ten kilos this


40
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.009
alpha male is the strongest and most powerful
koala


41
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.209
in the colony.


42
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.329
He's ruled this place through sheer brute
force.


43
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.809
And now


44
00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:01.329
he's come to flex his muscles.


45
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:21.359
he makes sure the rival male is put back
in his place.


46
00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:32.468
Asserting his dominance, he maintains the right


47
00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:38.228
to mate with this female. The losers retreat
to the sidelines,


48
00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:43.339
dominance can change quickly, it's a fine
line between playing today's


49
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:50.228
alpha male and tomorrow's outcasts.


50
00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.069
Calm returns to the colony and the
koalas go back to the business


51
00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:03.249
of browsing on gum leaves.


52
00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.779
Gum leaves a highly toxic and this noxious diet


53
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.669
was once believed to send the koalas into
drunken state


54
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.379
hallucinating from toxic compounds, high


55
00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:19.149
in the trace. but lethargy is merely an


56
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:26.649
energy-saving adaptation to their poor diet.


57
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.459
it takes a lot of work to chew a leave, and
koalas need to eat for


58
00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:36.339
4 hours a day to get enough calories.


59
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.429
And this female is eating for 2.

60
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.589
nestled in her part is a six-month
old joey


61
00:06:48.590 --> 00:07:01.569
who occasionally ventures outside.


62
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.709
For the last six months the baby has
been suckling milk


63
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:09.089
from the breasts inside his mother's pouch.


64
00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.899
But now in readiness for eating leaves
he must consume


65
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.598
her feces for these contain a
secretion that gives him the bacteria


66
00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:18.469
needed to


67
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:24.679
digest tough eucalyptus leaves.



68
00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:34.099
The joey is keen to explore his new
world


69
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.619
he communicates with his mother with
squeaks


70
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:45.669
and murmurs.


71
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.919
He will stay by her side until a
year old,


72
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.399
by then he will be smart to the ways koala's
society


73
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:59.609
and street wise enough to navigate in
the suburbs.


74
00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.609
But for now he must be content with
hanging out


75
00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:16.529
on mum.


76
00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.789
In this patch of forest in the Brisbane
suburb of Pinetree


77
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:24.139
biologists from Griffith University have
been studying the movement koalas for


78
00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:31.839
two years.


79
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.719
Catherine Dexter and David Black want to
understand the social dynamics


80
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:45.379
within a koala colony that's surrounded
by the suburbs.


81
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:50.759
We track the animals weekly trying to
get an understanding of how far they're moving


82
00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:56.719
and how they're interacting. One other thing we're
trying to do is capture


83
00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.088
more koalas and put collars on them to track


84
00:09:00.089 --> 00:09:07.469
their movements.

85
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:14.139
Can you just check some of the details for me?


86
00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:17.809
alright so, can you see her arms. Yeah
her arms are good


87
00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:21.209
is that good? OK and,


88
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:24.739
can you see the coat? yeah the coat's fine


89
00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:30.409
claws very active. The next step


90
00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:35.338
is to snare this koala to add him to
the study, so a team of expert catchers


91
00:09:35.339 --> 00:09:41.729
has been called in.


92
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:53.659
They use a poll to coax the Koala down
from the tree.


93
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:11.509
It‘s beautiful.


94
00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:18.359
Hang on. Put it over his head.


95
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:28.669
Each and every one of our koalas, 
which is now over 70 


96
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:29.419
for this project



97
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:34.059
has a full health check at the beginning,
we give the animal


98
00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:37.728
a light sedative, so once it�s asleep, we pop the collar on.


99
00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:43.719
we collar koalas
because we want to track them


100
00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.829
when we catch them the put a either a
VHF


101
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:50.379
or a GPS collar on them, so you have
every four hour fixes


102
00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.959
and this gives us a really clear
indication of how they're moving without having


103
00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.929
to track them every day.


104
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:59.129
one of the nice things about this project is naming the


105
00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:03.229
koalas and we have a little bit of fun with 
that. Some good names we have come up with are


106
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:07.999
rock stars or movie stars. They've
called this koala


107
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.049
hendrix after the legendary guitarist.


108
00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:16.279
So once the collar is fitted. We take it
back to the tree we caught it and release


109
00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:16.649
it.


110
00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:20.169
Once we have downloaded the data,


111
00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:29.799
it gives us information where the animals have 
moved over the past four months.


112
00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.379
Good luck fella.


113
00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.089
For me personally to be involved in
projects like this which


114
00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:40.359
is going to have major outcomes 
that's enormously satisfying.


115
00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.539
It's now September


116
00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.949
and change is in the air.


117
00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:50.729
It's the start of the breeding season and the alpha male
is restless,


118
00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.759
his testosterone levels are rising and


119
00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.709
he's staying close to the female.


120
00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:02.409
The rival male keeps his distance
because he doesn't want another fight.


121
00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:09.198
but there's movement below,


122
00:12:09.199 --> 00:12:12.458
an outsider has entered the colony. so the
Alpha male


123
00:12:12.459 --> 00:12:17.828
decides to investigate.



124
00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:23.348
The intruder is a young four-year-old
traveling male


125
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:27.239
a wonderer who has left his native colony to
try his luck


126
00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.719
with females elsewhere. 


127
00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:35.179
But he's not welcome here. 


128
00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:38.478
When there is conflict, koalas talk to
each other


129
00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.219
to avoid a fight.


130
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:51.659
The alpha male reacts to the arrival of
a traveling male with a guttural bellow.


131
00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.759
That's his way of saying, 


132
00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:58.889
I'm the boss get out of my territory. 


133
00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:02.489
And the intruder replies yeah make me.


134
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.729
But the alpha male is having none of it,


135
00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:13.569
he bellows harder. 


136
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.229
Though not much larger than a cat he sounds


137
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:22.409
as big as a lion.


138
00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:26.869
The intimidation tactic seems to have
worked, the traveller

139
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:30.299
decides to move on.


140
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:36.159
But there is more than one male in 
this colony.


141
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.429
These two males embark on a different
form of communication.



142
00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:47.929
First, the travelers smears his scent


143
00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:52.069
on the tree, hoping this odour will intimidate
other males


144
00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:58.419
and attract females.


145
00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.259
Adult males have a scent patch


146
00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:06.079
on their chest which they use to mark
their territory.


147
00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:20.309
The resident male replies by scent-marking
back.


148
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:23.968
Once the traveler catches a whiff of


149
00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:27.139
the resident male's scent he realizes
retreat


150
00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:30.869
is probably the best option.


151
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:39.968
But traveling males don� t give up easily
and


152
00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:43.649
as darkness descends on the forest patch
the traveler


153
00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:47.029
bide his time and prepares to mount


154
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:49.719
a surprise attack.


155
00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:57.028
Under the cover of night the traveling
male returns to the colony to challenge


156
00:14:57.029 --> 00:14:57.338
the


157
00:14:57.339 --> 00:15:01.889
alpha male to duel. 


158
00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:05.319
The


159
00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.469
alpha male forces the intruder into the
end of the branch.


160
00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.969
Far from cute and cuddly the alpha male turns


161
00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:28.778
feral and the fur flies.


162
00:15:28.779 --> 00:15:33.328
96% of all male to male
encounters results in both males


163
00:15:33.329 --> 00:15:34.137
backing off,


164
00:15:34.139 --> 00:15:45.459
but not this time.


165
00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:48.129
The intruder has no choice but to
retreat to the


166
00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:55.589
end of the branch and he has lost this
battle.


167
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:58.739
The alpha male declares victory with an
almighty bellow.


168
00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:02.369
He wants all the koalas in the colony
to know


169
00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:07.389
he's still king.



170
00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:16.629
Similar battles for koala dominance have
being played in patches of forest through



171
00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:23.229
out Queensland suburbia. 


172
00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:27.009
The language of koalas had been a
mystery until two biologists from the


173
00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:28.469
University of Queensland


174
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:35.719
delved deeper into its meaning.


175
00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.379
In order to crack the code of koala
communication, Dr. Bill Ellis


176
00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:44.078
and Sean FitzGibbon
conduct an unusual experiment.


177
00:16:44.079 --> 00:16:49.439
The Koala social system seems to be a
lot more complex than we might've otherwise


178
00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.518
thought. the question really was


179
00:16:52.519 --> 00:16:55.648
who are koalas bellowing to? Are they
advertising


180
00:16:55.649 --> 00:17:00.619
are they trying to ward other males
off? What exactly is going on


181
00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:04.139
with all the bellowing. 


182
00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:07.318
We were attracted


183
00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:10.618
to this particular spot because we heard
a bellow. 


184
00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:13.628
It seem like a useful tool


185
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:16.708
recording an individual's bellows and
playing them back  


186
00:17:16.709 --> 00:17:20.948
to find under what circumstances a
koala might respond to a bellow.


187
00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:27.389
For this experiment, Bill and Sean are
joined by British acoustic biologist


188
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:33.249
Dr. Ben Sheldon. the idea is to play
back the guttural calls of


189
00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:37.249
male koalas to a female and pair her
reaction to each.


190
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:42.918
The first sound played is the
bellow


191
00:17:42.919 --> 00:17:46.428
from a small male koala. 


192
00:17:46.429 --> 00:17:49.409
Just gonna play that one. it's gonna be a small



193
00:17:53.559 --> 00:17:58.239
A head-turn is a good response as far
as the sign is concerned.


194
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.979
Next they play a bellow from a large male


195
00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:09.219
to see what response they get.


196
00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:14.019
She seems impressed looks like she wants
to get to know the owner of


197
00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:17.489
this bellow a little better. 


198
00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:21.259
Moving towards the sound, so the female koala can gauge


199
00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.829
characteristics of the male from their
bellow. 


200
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:28.359
We're pretty sure now


201
00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.658
that the bellow is an individual
signature


202
00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:34.739
of male is components in the bellow


203
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.789
that indicate how big the male is


204
00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:42.099
so what we think that probably females
are able to select


205
00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:45.308
large individual males simply by their
bellow.


206
00:18:45.309 --> 00:18:48.839
But the love serenade


207
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:55.109
is over once a dog arrives.


208
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:59.628
Self-preservation is more
important than curiosity


209
00:18:59.629 --> 00:19:04.399
and romance. 


210
00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.159
And koalas are found almost exclusively
on Australia's


211
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:13.669
East Coast. Two hundred years ago
koala habitat was abundant,


212
00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:17.179
but today it is so fragmented that the koalas
cling on


213
00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:21.789
isolated pockets. Only a few
survive in the suburbs


214
00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:26.099
of Melbourne and Sydney. Brisbane is
the last big city


215
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.849
where they're found in numbers.


216
00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:33.539
The study in northern
Brisbane highlights a patchwork effect in  



217
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:38.449
the forest and suburbs. Any koala that ventures


218
00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:43.379
out of the bushes here ends up on the
streets, and on their tile are


219
00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.589
biologists Catherine Dexter and David
Black.


220
00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:52.079
We get them sitting in people's
backyards, we just wouldn't think that they want


221
00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.129
to live.


222
00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:58.669
you think generally they would be by the bush
but we find them quite frequently out


223
00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:01.309
in the suburbs.


224
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:05.709
They range quite away from they should be



225
00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:20.298
Dave has been collecting home video
footage from residents have come into


226
00:20:20.299 --> 00:20:21.759
contact with koalas


227
00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:29.949
in the suburbs, and some of what they've
seen is rather bizarre.


228
00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:33.339
I really find it fascinating how the koalas
are let into the suburbs.



229
00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:40.339
I've seen koalas in backyards where dogs have killed koalas
before,


230
00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.509
really heart-breaking.


231
00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:52.749
In the suburbs you see really strange
behaviors.


232
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:59.329
You see them in really strange trees and going
through backyards and houses.


233
00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:05.379
There are some risks that they're taking to
going to the suburban environment. 


234
00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:11.829
You really get a feeling for how
threatened they are in their everyday lives.


235
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:18.408
Living in the city comes with challenges.
Koalas may have started lives


236
00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:22.819
in the slow lane but freeways now
intersect their bushland homes.


237
00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:31.258
A one-third of all koala deaths in
southeast Queensland


238
00:21:31.259 --> 00:21:33.659
are from vehicle impact.


239
00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.639
The Griffith University biologists are
helping koalas


240
00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:42.889
to move freely without having to
interact with busy roads.


241
00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:46.139
They're planting trees on bridges to link koala
corridors 


242
00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:49.259
and adapting underpasses to encourage
koalas to go


243
00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:53.889
under the roads.


244
00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:56.288
Cars are the number one direct killer


245
00:21:56.289 --> 00:21:59.418
of koalas. the fundamental question


246
00:21:59.419 --> 00:22:03.069
we're trying to ask is do koalas use underpasses that had been


247
00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:06.809
developed for them.


248
00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:10.009
We want to get visual proof that they were
crossing these structures


249
00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:13.839
so we set up cameras at every possible
location that they could be crossing


250
00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:19.438
that had yet no expectations by many to be
fantastic and see koala by such a long shot.


251
00:22:27.609 --> 00:22:31.688
it's early morning in the colony and
the koalas are in no hurry


252
00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:37.069
to join the rush hour. Mother and Baby


253
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:42.209
are enjoying the Tonka. now nine months
old


254
00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:45.398
the joey spends much of his time
eating gum leaves.


255
00:22:45.399 --> 00:22:51.638
He carefully sniffs


256
00:22:51.639 --> 00:22:58.788
each leave and stalk to avoid the most
toxic.


257
00:22:58.789 --> 00:23:01.528
Koalas have a keen sense of smell and


258
00:23:01.529 --> 00:23:08.729
are quite finicky about which leaves to eat. 
the joey still relies on his


259
00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:23.309
mother for milk and will regularly
put his head back in the pouch for a drink.


260
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:27.079
At this age he becomes quite
adventurous and will wonder away from mom


261
00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:35.259
to explore the new world.


262
00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:55.009
But there are many scary sights and
sounds nearby.


263
00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:59.949
So he decides it's best to be by his
mother's side where it feels safe and warm.


264
00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:11.509
By late spring, storm clouds


265
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:15.689
are brewing.


266
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:22.438
It's the beginning of the severe weather
season in southeast Queensland.


267
00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.589
This time of the year, 100 millimetres of rain
can fall


268
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:38.509
in a single day, drenching the koala
colony.


269
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:42.558
The fur on a koala's bottom is
densely packed to provide a cushion for


270
00:24:42.559 --> 00:24:43.639
the hard branches


271
00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:47.519
and insulation from the wet and the
cold.


272
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:58.688
Once the rain stops, the mother and joey
need to make up for lost time.


273
00:25:07.799 --> 00:25:10.898
Koala spend only five hours a day being
active


274
00:25:10.899 --> 00:25:15.267
and 19 hours a day resting or sleeping so
every waking minute


275
00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:20.529
counts. 


276
00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:23.899
Feeding is always the highest priority


277
00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:27.049
come rain or shine


278
00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:41.688
As the sea of suburbia spread, the koala
habitat


279
00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:48.558
is reduced to a small island of bush.


280
00:26:01.399 --> 00:26:07.109
The traveling male will never experience the
native bush that his ancestors knew.


281
00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:10.868
Instead he will contend with all the
stresses of living within


282
00:26:10.869 --> 00:26:21.469
the urban sprawl.


283
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:26.219
Traveling koalas are known to run for up to ten
kilometers to find another colony.


284
00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:29.558
But in suburbia today


285
00:26:29.559 --> 00:26:36.399
the remaining gum trees needed for food
can be few and far between.


286
00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:40.499
And to make matters worse the traveling
mom has unwittingly stumbled


287
00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:47.418
into another male's territory.


288
00:26:47.419 --> 00:26:50.658
the resident male isn't keen on
visitors at all.


289
00:26:50.659 --> 00:27:15.178
He makes sure the traveller knows he's
not welcome in his patch.


290
00:27:15.179 --> 00:27:18.839
The rules in the jungle still apply even
in an urban jungle


291
00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:42.499
and males must confront each other to
sort out the picking order.


292
00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:55.069
The traveler has been cast out once more.


293
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:58.819
He crosses the creek to get away


294
00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:02.639
from the occupied territory.


295
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:06.469
He's not particularly elegant in the water
as his body is actually designed for


296
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:07.819
climbing trees, but


297
00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:12.789
he can dog-paddle his way to safety.


298
00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:16.299
He is persistent for a good reason while
Alpha males dominate


299
00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:20.319
in size, chances are the traveller will
find females


300
00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:27.639
by stealth. If he can sneak under the
rader.


301
00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:32.339
Biologists Catherine and David have often
seen territorial dispute amongst


302
00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:33.259
the koalas


303
00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.569
that they've been studying.



304
00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:41.479
A few months ago they were tracking two
koalas one was the young male.


305
00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:44.079
Hendrix they put a collar on a few
months ago,


306
00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:48.809
and the other was an Alpha male
call James.



307
00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:57.109
Their picking order was very clear.


308
00:28:57.110 --> 00:29:03.048
James had access to the best trees, and
was preventing Hendricks from using them.


309
00:29:03.049 --> 00:29:07.349
Then everything changed.


310
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:11.739
James became diseased and so was caught
and taken to an animal hospital where he


311
00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:12.409
remained


312
00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:18.849
for two and a half months. 


313
00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:24.819
While James was absent Hendrix took over his
territory.


314
00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:28.928
When James was eventually released back
into the wild he was immediately pushed


315
00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:32.739
out of the forest by Hendrix and forced to
live in the suburbs.

  

316
00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:39.269
The interesting thing is now Hendrix who
is the


317
00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:42.759
young challenger was now sitting in trees where James had once sat.



318
00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:49.089
Obviously James had to find somewhere else
to go 


319
00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:52.809
He's had to cross quite a number of roads


320
00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:56.189
and negotiated fences, dogs,


321
00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:59.709
all sorts of things.


322
00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:06.829
It was a couple weeks ago when he was still
sitting in that backyard.


323
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:10.158
The significance of these discoveries
is that it shows how quickly


324
00:30:10.159 --> 00:30:13.509
colony dynamics change when a dominant
koala is removed or


325
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:16.518
incapacitated but disease.


326
00:30:16.519 --> 00:30:20.999
And disease is something the biologists
are seeing more and more of.


327
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.109
Chlamydia the predominately sexually
transmitted disease


328
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:28.478
is rampant in the koala populations
across Queensland.


329
00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.768
Now it appears mighty Hendrix


330
00:30:31.769 --> 00:30:35.569
has succumbed. We're going to try the other one now, the sick one.


331
00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:42.879
Will take a look at it first.


332
00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.829
So when we find a diseased koala we try
our hardest to capture it as quickly as


333
00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:47.418
possible


334
00:30:47.419 --> 00:30:50.869
and get it to Wildlife
Hospital because It'll get it the best


335
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:56.658
chance of surviving.


336
00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:02.808
It's a pretty distressing situation
because you become attached to them 


337
00:31:02.809 --> 00:31:07.449
and also you know you had do something about it.



338
00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:17.079
We check the conditional of the coats, the eyes.



339
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:22.798
The other thing we do is a body
score,


340
00:31:22.799 --> 00:31:26.339
and that's done by checking the back at
the shoulder blades there


341
00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:29.639
making sure that there's a nice
thickness in the muscle there


342
00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:33.048
and that generally gives an indication of how healthy
that animal is.


343
00:31:33.049 --> 00:31:37.629
Lucky for Hendrix, he was found to
have only


344
00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:41.619
a mild case of Chlamydia and was
treated and returned within a fortnight


345
00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:42.789
before James


346
00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:48.308
had a chance to re-invade his old
stomping ground.


347
00:31:48.309 --> 00:31:51.528
Left untreated chlamydia can cause
conjunctivitis


348
00:31:51.529 --> 00:31:59.699
and blind the animal.


349
00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:03.418
It can also lead to wet bottom, a urine
retract infection that discolours


350
00:32:03.419 --> 00:32:06.859
the fur on the koala's rear.


351
00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:10.058
A new vaccine for chlamydia is being trialed
and it's hoped


352
00:32:10.059 --> 00:32:14.349
this reduces the spread of the disease. 


353
00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:20.018
Chlamydia often spreads throughout the koala
population by sexual activity.


354
00:32:20.019 --> 00:32:23.689
But regardless of the threat of
disease


355
00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:26.709
when the females are in estrus and in
the mood


356
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:29.839
there is little stopping tree-top
romance.


357
00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:34.418
throwing a head back and forht may be
a sign that the female 


358
00:32:34.419 --> 00:32:40.069
is now ovulating. Mating only
lasts a few minutes and then the male


359
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:44.249
is off.


360
00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:48.729
Male koalas play no role in parenting.



361
00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:54.688
Other males are hanging around but their
chances of getting lucky


362
00:32:54.690 --> 00:33:01.769
are thwarted in more ways than one.


363
00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:05.619
Apart from guarding the females from advances of
other suitors?he has secreted a


364
00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:08.738
gelatinous plug that glues his genital
tract together.


365
00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:19.989
A final attempt to ensure she becomes
pregnant with his young.


366
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:22.289
The breeding habits of koalas are being
studied


367
00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:25.859
by biologist Dr. Bill Ellis and Dr.
Sean FitzGibbon.


368
00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:29.718
And recently they made an important
discovery.


369
00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:33.359
The surprising thing that we found was
that


370
00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:38.178
large resident males within the
population were only siring about 50 percent



371
00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:42.849
of the offspring you had these transient
males that tended to come


372
00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:47.079
and go and lo and behold it was these
transient males


373
00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:50.239
that were siring the offspring. 


374
00:33:58.310 --> 00:34:03.329
The transient or traveling male


375
00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:07.739
is important for maintaining genetic
diversity especially in areas where


376
00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:12.618
overcrowding and inbreeding occurs.


377
00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:20.518
This is one of the big problems for
koalas in the suburbs.


378
00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:24.198
On the Gold Coast, a new
suburb is being built around a small


379
00:34:24.199 --> 00:34:27.958
remnant of bush land.


380
00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.478
In this forest patch as many as 15 koalas
live inside an


381
00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:36.248
area that would normally support only a
few.


382
00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:40.167
Bill and Sean studied six of these koalas
and followed their movements for four


383
00:34:40.168 --> 00:34:45.228
months to see how they�re affected by
overcrowding.


384
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:48.718
Like Catherine and David's study, they found
males were being pushed


385
00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:53.288
out of the forest and onto the
surrounding streets. 


386
00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:56.508
There's just not enough spice in there for the koalas that
need to live in this area.


387
00:34:56.510 --> 00:35:01.999
Now if this many koalas crammed into
a small area


388
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.368
they are under a lot more pressure which
explains why


389
00:35:05.369 --> 00:35:09.469
in some of these crowded isolated
fragments we do see a lot of disease.


390
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:18.428
One of the koalas that Bill and Sean tracked


391
00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:23.408
was a mature male called Houdini. So this is
where we were earlier.


392
00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:32.298
He had definitely come in through one of these fencs.


393
00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:35.689
Houdini occupied a small patch of
trees between a road


394
00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:43.499
and some houses and then tried to move
into the central bushy area.


395
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:48.098
But it was already crowded so the
resident male koalas prevented Houdini


396
00:35:48.099 --> 00:35:51.149
from entering not once but four times.


397
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:54.638
So Houdini was forced to settle for a
life


398
00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:57.749
in the median strip. Briefly it looks
like but


399
00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:01.299
by and large he is just hanging in that tiny
little patch there.


400
00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:05.129
Koalas obviously have a really complex


401
00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:09.409
social system and I think there's no doubt
that what we're doing


402
00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:13.698
in their environment is breaking that
system down on.


403
00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:18.769
The joey is now a year old and getting to big
to be carried along.


404
00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:23.959
he is becoming increasingly curious
and is happy to wonder away from


405
00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.029
mum and explore for


406
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:30.288
hours on end. 



407
00:36:35.979 --> 00:36:39.097
He's almost fully independent now.



408
00:36:42.539 --> 00:36:47.578
His mother is not producing milk
anymore and won't suckle him again.



409
00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:55.698
So he has to rely on gum least but is
not yet that good at getting them down 


410
00:36:55.700 --> 00:37:00.019
His throat. 



411
00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:14.129
Like his mother he will survive


412
00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:18.669
exclusively on eucalyptus leaves
throughout his expected life span of 12


413
00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:19.239
years.


414
00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:28.788
4 kilometers away from Patri


415
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:34.769
is the Bruce Highway, it's the main
freeway in Queensland. It's hard to


416
00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:37.279
believe that a Koala would ever
try to cross


417
00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:41.209
such a busy road but that's what
biologists Catherine Dexter and David Black


418
00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:45.319
have come to investigate.


419
00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.649
One of the things that we understand
about roads is the barriers


420
00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:50.469
and you would suspect a six-lane highway


421
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:55.548
to be a major barrier to an animal.


422
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:59.229
They don't seem to have any
sort of concept of


423
00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:03.149
a busy road to a non-busy road, they
seem to be driven to go in a direction and


424
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:03.799
they just go.


425
00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.869
They've tacked the intrepid


426
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:10.008
captain Bogart close to this bustling
spot


427
00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:13.379
and now retrace the steps to understand
how he arrived


428
00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:16.429
at this place. 


429
00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:20.388
So with captain Bogart once we are
able to get his GPS collar


430
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:23.769
off, download the data and understand his
movements,


431
00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:29.368
we could really see that held done this
massive walk.


432
00:38:29.369 --> 00:38:31.779
The tracking data reveals captain Bogart


433
00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:35.019
Run around a patchwork next to a major intersection


434
00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:41.328
on the Bruce Highway.


435
00:38:41.329 --> 00:38:46.028
Then he went over a busy overpass going
to and fro crossing it no less


436
00:38:46.029 --> 00:38:50.678
than five times.


437
00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:55.709
But the traveling male�s journey didn't
end there.


438
00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:58.828
He walked along the highway four one and a half
kilometres


439
00:38:58.829 --> 00:39:03.749
then did something no one believed was
possible, he crossed the highway


440
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:09.759
all six lines of it.


441
00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:17.359
This is a truly amazing feat for a
tree-dwelling animal.


442
00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:20.729
When I first saw this I couldn't believe
what was happening


443
00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:24.319
that's just insane, we wouldn't think that
they would try to across a six-lane


444
00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.929
highway.


445
00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:30.148
I think anyone so saying that sort of
interaction with roads


446
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:33.999
and major roads and how lucky he's
been to actually have been able to survive 


447
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:34.529
all that.


448
00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:41.559
Two months ago Catherine and David
installed spy cameras


449
00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:45.798
inside a local underpass to find out
whether the koalas were using it.


450
00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:50.439
Today they discover the results. 


451
00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:55.098
These are the older images of the underpass
Caught on cameras.


452
00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:59.048
First one, not yet. 


453
00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:03.899
The quality is
actually really good


454
00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:08.089
Not yet.


455
00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:11.489
I could see his tail.


456
00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:14.738
Holy! It's definitely a Koala.


457
00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:18.008
Go next! oh my god!


458
00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:21.459
This is amazing you know what this means. I
actually think we have got


459
00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:25.298
The first ever recorded pictures, I mean, 


460
00:40:25.299 --> 00:40:28.158
of a koala using a retro-fitted 


461
00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:31.738
Underpass. Now that we've actually have
confirmation


462
00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:35.128
for the retrofitting out the areas
where we know koalas are crossing.


463
00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:39.209
The work that we've done is gonna have
some really


464
00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:42.288
long term implications for koalas to


465
00:40:42.289 --> 00:40:50.619
allow them to be able to live in harmony
with people.


466
00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:55.709
Today is a big day for one little koala.


467
00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:59.808
The Joey has reached the first stage
of adulthood and is now


468
00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:03.899
13 months old. His mother leaves with 


469
00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:16.788
friendly bide, that the time has come for him to
stop relying on her.


470
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:21.008
It's time to expand his horizons and
find out what the world is like across


471
00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:23.449
the street.



472
00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:42.107
Mom watches as if she wanted to say goodbye.


473
00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:49.999
He'll remain in his mother's range
for at least the next year.


474
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.279
Not used to never navigating his way at street level he stumbles


475
00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:57.029
into a backyard.



476
00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:02.368
This is a strange place with exotic
plants and alarming sounds



477
00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:18.449
He heads for high ground.


478
00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:21.788
Depending on how strong he grows over
the next few years,


479
00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:25.649
He'll either become travelling male
continually wandering the streets


480
00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:31.509
or alpha male rises through the ranks
of koala society.


481
00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:42.189
As long as there is still a colony in
the neighborhood for him to conquer.



482
00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:58.658
By the end of summer the koalas' mating
season is drawing to a close.


483
00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:02.568
For six months the males have been working
out their place in the picking order


484
00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:10.839
and the prize is to mate with a
female.


485
00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:13.899
but the alpha male stays close to her,
and


486
00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:30.219
his intention is clear.


487
00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:31.918
The tenderness between them is over


488
00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:35.729
now that she's pregnant she's no longer
interested in sex


489
00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:42.709
and she's taken to rejecting him.



490
00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:54.408
Against all odds the traveling male has
made it back to the colony.


491
00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:58.749
He senses the weakness in the alpha male
and seizes the opportunity to challenge


492
00:43:58.750 --> 00:43:59.288
him


493
00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:03.359
for control of the domain.


494
00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:06.939
He's been waiting for this moment all
breeding season and


495
00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:09.209
He's not holding back.


496
00:44:56.680 --> 00:45:00.888
The alpha is forced to relinquish
his dominance


497
00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:04.249
to the new champion. The traveler


498
00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:07.567
has triumphed at last he's earned the
right


499
00:45:07.569 --> 00:45:15.198
to mate with this felmale.


500
00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:19.298
His resilience has kept him alive and
allowed him to rise to the top


501
00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:26.209
of the Koala society.


502
00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:30.209
Only the tougher survival live in suburbia.


503
00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:34.548
Koalas have adapted to the changes that we
humans have created.


504
00:45:37.339 --> 00:45:41.327
Though with fewer wild stretches of koala habitats left
in Queensland.


505
00:45:41.329 --> 00:45:46.919
Urbanization is the reality koalas
will face.


506
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:51.229
whether the Koala can continue this
tenuous existence: 


507
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:53.868
only time will tell.
