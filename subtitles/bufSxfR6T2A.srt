1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.159
Over the breeding enclosure, everything
is set the introduction of Nina and


2
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.779
amiga. I'm going to be going into the
enclosure myself. I'm going to take a


3
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.409
little not to protect myself, but just in
case there is any adverse reaction


4
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.197
between the two cats, so I need a broom
just to stop surprising that if we do


5
00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.348
get her reaction. Snow leopards are
powerful predators that can inflict


6
00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.869
serious harm on each other and us. Other
collections would never dream of


7
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.549
entering a big cat enclosure like this
during an introduction, but Terry trust


8
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.689
his cats and takes everything in stride,
a risky business. With Nina still


9
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.529
snoozing on top of the platform, it's up
to amiga to come out and introduce


10
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.529
herself.


13
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:18.689
It's not usual in the wild for female
snow leopards to share territory and


14
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.689
Nina's instincts are kicking in.


17
00:01:35.159 --> 00:02:00.269
Submissive Amiga doesn't want to fight,
and goes to see what you can find out about


18
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:15.119
this new unfriendly housemate. All she is
doing is checking out the smells from


19
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:22.828
Nina, the beauty of Atlas, is that because
Nina worse when she's urinated and


20
00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:24.119
dedicated in here,  


21
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.869
she hasn't been under stress so those
one contained threatening smiles, they


22
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.389
pheromones, they produce can indicate to
another cat whether the cat is aggressive


23
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:43.827
or not, so she's picking out the play
this isn't an aggressive cat so you


24
00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:52.389
know how cats have another approach and
see if we can be friends.


25
00:02:52.390 --> 00:03:04.928
But Nina is on the way down to see Amiga.
Amiga by rubbing up against the walls


26
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.019
and showing Mina her head is displaying
submissive behavior.


27
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:32.468
With Nina's back turn Amiga sees an
opportunity to get our own back, it will


28
00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:38.198
take time for them to work out each
other's boundaries. Amiga is quite happy to


29
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.517
be friends,


30
00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:53.828
she's just wanting to get close to
show that she's not. While everyone is on


31
00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:59.438
tenterhooks, Terry is the coolest cat
around even taken time out to answer his


32
00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:06.969
mobile phone. As Amiga walks away,
Nina is still wound up 


33
00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:25.549
and turns her attention to the other
strangers Mary closure, us.


34
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.269
We have nothing to worry about, we are
protected by terry's trustee brune,


35
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:52.769
and Nina soon turns our attention back
to Amiga. It may take time for Nina to


36
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.329
fully accept Amiga as her housemate but
once they are coupled with each other


37
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.629
they'll be introduced to an unrelated
male in the hope that at least one of


38
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:07.139
them will make a produce cubs, as the
day ends it's difficult to forget that


39
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:13.229
so recently we lost Terbes and her cubs,
something Terry will take time to overcomes.


40
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:23.009
Next time, family Feud around the dinner
table.


41
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.459
Terry goes in a rare unusual road trip


42
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.549
and time to meet the man of the moment.


43
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:58.959
I'm Adrian kale I'm a wildlife filmmaker
I've spent years traveling the globe,


44
00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.899
filming some of the world's most
fascinating creatures, but right now I'm


45
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:10.059
just a stone's throw from London England
and here in this leafy paradise


46
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:15.399
I've discovered something quite
extraordinary. Just behind this


47
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:25.839
nonchalant looking farm shop is
something that is very un-English. A


48
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.839
secret world of snow leopards,


49
00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:34.948
and lots of them. Behind you Terry!


50
00:06:35.459 --> 00:06:39.388
Dr. Terry More runs the cat
survival trust,


51
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.379
a haven for all cats and home to one of
the biggest collections of snow leopards


52
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:51.839
on the planet. With snow leopard numbers
falling rapidly in the wild,


53
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:58.529
each one of these endangered cats here
is special and each birth precious. Come


54
00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:08.818
with me and meet the snow leopards of leafy london!
The farm shop is already opened for


55
00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:14.579
business and customers are starting to 
unaware of the WildWorld are waking up


56
00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.918
before them.


57
00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:20.758
No two days here at the trust are the
same. Today is no exception


58
00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:25.198
I've only just arrived, Terry's already
taken a call that may well provide a


59
00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:27.149
free meal for the cats.


60
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:35.758
The local police have found a good
idea for us so we're gonna have to drop


61
00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:39.658
everything and go and pick up another
deer. Something that happens quite


62
00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:40.559
frequently,


63
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:49.198
fortunately because our cats do love
deer. There we are! There it is. Of course they


64
00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:52.369
have hided it well! That's good


65
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:57.888
Let's load it up. It's not common for
the local authorities to contact Terry


66
00:07:57.889 --> 00:08:01.849
when animals hit by cars are left on the
roadside. Oh boys!


67
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:06.379
Terry's cleanup service removed the risk
of further accidents and offers a


68
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.379
natural recycling solution in the
process.


69
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:16.399
Back at the trust, Robert prepares the
cat food in a very maturafly way.


70
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:24.499
Firstly i'm going to take the four legs
off, the fore legs and the behind legs.


71
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:30.409
Behind legs are really good by has
lots of meat when I thought a region. Once that's


72
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:39.978
done I'm going to take the neck off.
While Rob is going about his business as


73
00:08:39.979 --> 00:08:44.959
the master butcher, the smell coming off
that carcass is quite repulsive and I'm


74
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.609
sure the cats can smell it because


75
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:52.519
I certainly can. I have left Rob to his
glory task so all getting a bit gruesome


76
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:57.439
and I've come up here to check in on
Amiga and Nina. Now the two female snow


77
00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.979
leopards were recently introduced to
each other and I thought I'd see that


78
00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.269
they're playing nicely.


79
00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:08.689
Things are looking very peaceful in the
girls enclosure, Amiga appears to be fast


80
00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:11.129
asleep on the platform,


81
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:18.359
while Nina is down below in the grass,
rubbing her head against the wall mean


82
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:24.449
she is still busy scent marking the area.
As part of the trust snow leopard


83
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:28.739
breeding project, both females have been
put together in preparation for the next


84
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:36.089
breeding season. By scent marking, Nina is
making Amiga aware of her presence. They


85
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:39.989
are being given time to get to know each
other first, before meeting a new


86
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:48.329
breeding male. Up above, Amiga sleep is
disturbed by the sounds of a snow


87
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:49.379
leopard calling.


88
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:54.329
Nina recognizes the call and becomes
agitated.


89
00:09:55.470 --> 00:10:03.719
It's Kamal, her father from whom she was
recently separated.


90
00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:16.549
Solitaire and secretive in awhile, snow
leopards generally only call in the


91
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:20.689
breeding season to try too mate, but this
is not the mating season.


92
00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:29.749
It appears to simply be that Nina and
her dad are communicating.



94
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:57.479
As the calling subsides, Amiga has moved
down below and is taken a water incorporation


95
00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:04.229
for round two of getting to
know the very vocal Nina. With one of the


96
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:07.859
largest collection of snow leopards in
the world here at the trust, they become


97
00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:13.349
the main focus of Terry's work but this
is a sanctuary for all cats and the two


98
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:14.669
female pumas here,


99
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:20.039
KitKat and crunchy, are a major part of
the family. They're missing a man. So


100
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:28.289
today I'm heading to explore with Terry,
to remedy the situation. A female puma at


101
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:34.318
Exmoor zoo in Devon, gave birth to
triplets six months ago. The Cat Survival


102
00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:38.669
Trust has been carefully chosen to adopt
one of the triplets to pair up and


103
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:43.679
hopefully breathe with their two females.
It is vital for all zoos that the


104
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.098
captive population is kept genetically
healthy.


105
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:52.708
Thankfully for Terry, Kitkat and Crunchy are an
 ideal match for the young male. On


106
00:11:52.709 --> 00:11:53.939
arriving at the zoo,


107
00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:58.559
Danny Reynolds the curator it's Terry
with a bombshell. They don't actually


108
00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:04.198
know for sure that the young puma is a
male. We have sex them three times now, we


109
00:12:04.199 --> 00:12:07.888
still think is three boys the shear rate
at which they just suddenly start to


110
00:12:07.889 --> 00:12:11.039
grow their first the size of their
mother now. Although there's no


111
00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.729
development in the normal area would
expect that big animals are quite


112
00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:19.229
came to begin the placement of them.
Completely unfazed by the idea that the


113
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:21.509
Pumas sex is not yet confirmed.


114
00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:24.888
Terry has just came to meet the young
cat.


115
00:12:24.889 --> 00:12:29.778
But has to wait patiently, as Danny and
his zookeepers collect him from his


116
00:12:29.779 --> 00:12:37.998
enclosure. A good 20 minutes later, cat
box is full and Terry is introduced to


117
00:12:37.999 --> 00:12:43.878
his new family member. In his excitement,
you may have just missed the fact that


118
00:12:43.879 --> 00:12:48.498
the zoo didn't confirm the Pumas sex.
How do you feel? Very happy.


119
00:12:48.499 --> 00:12:55.878
What does he just know? He looks like a
really nice the young puma. After loading


120
00:12:55.879 --> 00:12:58.368
this unnamed puma into the van,


121
00:12:58.369 --> 00:13:05.628
it's straight back onto the road and
back to the trust. A quick break in


122
00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:10.159
the journey allows me to introduce
myself to the latest addition to Terry's


123
00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.148
cat family.


124
00:13:11.149 --> 00:13:15.648
He's already referred to the pumas a
male, so who might be otherwise? My


125
00:13:15.649 --> 00:13:19.818
first chance to get a real close look at
the young lad. He is doing well!


126
00:13:19.819 --> 00:13:24.978
He's calm very collected, very composed,
not aggressive with me being here and


127
00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:27.318
just looks beautiful six months old.


128
00:13:27.319 --> 00:13:31.488
You can see big ears, big paws, bit of
grown up to, bit of a body to grow into


129
00:13:31.489 --> 00:13:34.488
their, but the calm cat!


131
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.579
As we arrive back at the trust, there's
no rest as the young puma is carried


132
00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:51.129
through to his new accommodation. You can
probably tell my face that i'm somewhat


133
00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:59.439
happy. We got our potential male.
Potential male now. He's all arrived safe


134
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:06.159
and sound which is kind to introduce him
to his new quarters. Up until this point,


135
00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:11.468
the puma has had no actual contact with
humans as Exmoor is a non-contact zoo.


136
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:17.259
Open the box and standing behind it
therefore might appear for hardy but


137
00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:21.339
Terry is keen to start a relationship
with this beautiful cat as soon as


138
00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.649
possible.


139
00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:30.009
And of course
this means that the broom comes out to


140
00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:32.599
play.


141
00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:38.719
This is actually quite difficult
situation because he's technically


142
00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:44.388
cornered and he's going to come this way
in order to get into the inside quarters.


143
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:49.909
This is dangerous, the puma is a wild
animal, nervous and in a strange


144
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:53.958
environment. Calm as ever,


145
00:14:54.560 --> 00:15:05.358
Terry has a plan involving a bit of wood
and his trusty broom. He believes that by


146
00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:10.489
growing this wildcat, it will calm him,
create a bond and ultimately build a


147
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:16.249
trust between the two. In a short space
of time, something remarkable


148
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:17.479
happened.


149
00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:24.648
It's alright. And Terry reminded
me, just how extraordinary his


150
00:15:24.649 --> 00:15:30.289
relationship is, with cats. Just find a
shadow


151
00:15:32.889 --> 00:15:59.768
Okay good. Okay puma forward. It's been
a jam-packed day but what a beauty that


152
00:15:59.769 --> 00:16:05.798
young pumas is. Rob's completed
butchering his deer, now apparently snow


153
00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:09.818
leopard love a nice bit of venison so
he's put it to one side and he's gonna


154
00:16:09.819 --> 00:16:12.159
feed it to the twins and Tammy tomorrow.
