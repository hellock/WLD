1
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.299
Towards the elephants closest living
relatives, manatees and dugongs


2
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.899
still spend their lives in the water.


3
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.517
Elephants in Africa


4
00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:22.478
lives south of the Sahara Desert. Some
live in grasslands


5
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.179
called Savannah. Summers here are very
hot,


6
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.319
so these elephants have large


7
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.319
years to found their bodies, and the
wrinkly skin helps too.


8
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.058
After a shower or bath, moisture gets
trapped in all the nooks and crannies


9
00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.089
others can,


10
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:52.099
and helps keep them cool. Other elephants
live in the tropical forests of central


11
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.279
and western Africa.


12
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.479
These elephants have a smaller body and
tasks than the savanna elephants.


13
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.869
The elephant cousins in Asia


14
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.238
are also smaller in size. Their bodies
are suited them moist


15
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.079
Asian rainforest were cooling off is
easier.


16
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.479
His floppy ears aren't nearly as big as
an African elephants,


17
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:21.479
and his gray skin is less wrinkled.


18
00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:27.158
This


19
00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.349
African bull elephant may weigh as much
as eighty people


20
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.249
or six cars. His heart alone


21
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.249
can weigh as much as a young child. He's
also got really big feet,


22
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.079
up to one and a half meters, about five
feet around.


23
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.407
And his brain is larger than all
other land animals.


24
00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.499
A bit larger even than ours.


25
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.839
But big is just the beginning


26
00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.969
that crock has literally thousands of
muscles,


27
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.128
but there are no bones so it can move in
any direction.


28
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.158
It is so sensitive, it can pick up
a single blade of grass,


29
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.379
and get so strong


30
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.719
it can carry a tree trunk.


31
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.198
They don't actually drink with their
crock to pour water into their mouths.


32
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.629
A big elephant like this one could suck
up about three gallons,


33
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.478
thats 10 leaders at a time.


34
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.828
The truck is really just an extension of
his upper lip and nose,


35
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:40.829
which has evolved over many thousands of
years. It's the perfect tool


36
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.559
for reaching high or low to eat.


37
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.067
For scratching an itch,


38
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.639
and for clearing a path through the
brush.


39
00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.269
Elephants are great communicators. They
talk to each other with the large


40
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.249
repertoire,


41
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:12.249
growls, grunge, smart, some roars


42
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.289
Allowed trumpeting


43
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.899
gives warning and gathers the herd. Most
telephone communication is so low,


44
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.609
we can't even hear it, but his low
frequency rumbles can be heard by other


45
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.279
elephants


46
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.519
far away.


47
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.379
They may also communicate by sensing 
vibrations through the soft skin on the


48
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.509
pads at their feet.


49
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.619
This guy will spend most of the day


50
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.299
eating, putting away nearly 400 pounds,


51
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.519
180 kilos of food each day.


52
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.959
That means elephants pass a lot of
smelly methane gas,


53
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.029
and they produce a huge amount of poop


54
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.658
called dung.



55
00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.329
It's not so much to look at, but this
elephant poop is very important.


56
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.698
It is proceeds from the plant some leaves
that the elephant has even.


57
00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:33.019
On a dung beetle rolls around or carries
it below ground.


58
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.369
It helps replant new grasses increased.


59
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.668
In fact some seeds won't even germinate
if they don't pass through the elephants


60
00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.079
digestive tract.


61
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.089
In some areas, without elephants


62
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.679
a third of all big tree species would
completely die out.


63
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:56.109
Elephants contribute to the survival of
plants and other animals in many other


64
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.668
ways.


65
00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.008
Her journey through the high grass


66
00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:03.709
provides food for birds by disturbing
small reptiles


67
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:10.709
amphibians and insects. The depressions
left by her footprints contract rainfall,


68
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:17.509
giving smaller animals a place to drink.
Elephants are so important to the


69
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.299
biodiversity where they live,


70
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.249
but they are considered as the keystone species.
Like the center stone


71
00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.989
or keystone that holds up an arch,
elephants play a critical role in


72
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.759
supporting their ecosystem.


73
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.429
These huge animals were also very
important to people.


74
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.709
In Asia, elephants have had a special
role in society and culture for


75
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.019
thousands of years.


76
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.719
They provide transportation and help


77
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.689
with heavy lifting. Elephants even went
to war.


78
00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.839
they were like tax in ancient battles.


79
00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.119
There is an elephant guard called
Kenisha


80
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.119
in the Hindu religion. It uses the Lord of
success


81
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.859
The god of education, knowledge, wealth


82
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.289
and wisdom.


83
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.929
Elephants are in fact very intelligent
and self-aware,


84
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.159
right up there with dolphins, heaps and
humans.


85
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.668
They are one of only a few animals
including ourselves,


86
00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:28.668
who can recognize their own reflection
in a mirror.


87
00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:32.999
With many years have memory and
experience,


88
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.299
she knows where to find food and water
during drought.


89
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:41.409
And other things that are vital to the
well-being of the herd.


90
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:48.409
Like children,


91
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.459
young elephants are completely dependent
on their family.


92
00:06:54.460 --> 00:07:00.978
Together the herd provides love and
discipline.


93
00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:03.359
They teach the camps how to find food
and water,


94
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:10.359
even how to behave. That strong bond


95
00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.788
starts from the very beginning. A mother
elephant


96
00:07:17.789 --> 00:07:21.769
is pregnant for almost two whole years
before she gives birth.


97
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:26.249
This baby may look small next to its
mother,


98
00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.839
but already it weighs more than 250
pounds,


99
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.369
one hundred ten kilos.


100
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:38.499
A baby elephant needs to touch or be
touched by its mother


101
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.159
or another close relative every few
seconds for reassurance.
