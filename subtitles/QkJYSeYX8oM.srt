1
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.519
As the oh sorry for
real coniferous forests commonly known


2
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.069
as a Tigon stretch out to meet the
Pacific Ocean. The brown bear begins to 


3
00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:13.138
loses status as the national symbol of
Russia. They are


4
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.509
in the ridges of Secretaria Mountains. The
bear meets his great rival, the amur


5
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:25.199
tiger, proud, solitary and animatic
predator. The another tiger is one of the


6
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.639
largest of all the tiger sub-species
on earth and the early one will


7
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.228
survive in the snow drifts. Few
other countries in the world can build


8
00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.488
such great treasure. 


9
00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:01.228
The tiger is one of the nature's
most efficient hunters. In


10
00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.449
contrast to lions, wolves and hyenas
will survive by communal hunting. The


11
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.419
tiger hunts alone.


12
00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:15.478
He taxes his kingdom and
live unnecessary. Taking as much as it


13
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.478
needs to survive.


14
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.847
Many after successful hunts, 
survivors can relax and enjoy a


15
00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.509
box of second of peace and quiet for the next
couple of days.


16
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.488
Mild bow, red deer, seeker row and
other prey give a communal sight of


17
00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.488
relief.


18
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:36.109
not know what those are glad the Lord
know about on social changes i will try


19
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:42.859
yet the discs about to provide our wiki
a little more diet and water on


20
00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:50.119
television is also working it will
operate thousand yes it has got your


21
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.939
miss yourself here in those awful for
you I wish me . During the nineteen eighties,


22
00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.069
the boreal forest bounded in wild boar,
tigers were happy and well-fed.


23
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.809
Tigresses gave birth to many cubs,
assure that their litters


24
00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.919
would not face starvation.
This was for the first time in 40 years


25
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.228
of the more tiger conservation efforts
that the tigers population had hit high


26
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:22.728
with tigers colonising every potential
range, but in 1983 unfortunate struck hit


27
00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:28.429
by candace temple, the wild was doing
there to extinction. Tigers turn to red


28
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:34.189
and rouldeer as not alternative source of
food. However it never rains but


29
00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:40.249
it pours.Deep snows and the
winters of 1985 through 1987 brought


30
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:46.609
about a massive loss of angular prey.
With the bo real forest empty, it was


31
00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.129
virtually no food for the tiger to find.
During the famine, tigers started to


32
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.089
cramp populated areas
snatching dogs and attaching of livestocks.


33
00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:02.239
In the winter of 1986, tiger
tracks were found at the trolley bus


34
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.279
station in the suburbs of the city of Alabasta 
causing great panic among


35
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.069
residents. The Communist Party responded
quickly with a night of civilian


36
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:18.409
protection, a special brigade was going
to control big predators. Literally


37
00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:24.769
it's stood for war on invasive tigers.
According to official permits, 48


38
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.038
catholic tigers were killed during the
anti-tiger crusade.


39
00:05:54.670 --> 00:06:00.819
At the time, these killings went
unbastion. Tigers that had come


40
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.259
out from the depths of the forest were
perceived as dangerous and receive death


41
00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:13.929
sentences without investigation on trial.


42
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:53.689
During that time, it’s a burren
boreal forest had not yet been


43
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:59.119
pillaged by Huracias timpeldealers and 
was still reaching Richard Korean pine.


44
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.889
It was here that the most
cautious tigers found their refuge.


45
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:08.419
Those of them who has learnt
their lesson well. Man is the most mortal


46
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.239
danger and you should keep away from him


47
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.239
ideally beyond the distance of a
rifle shot.


48
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:28.489
Korean pine forests are the unique ecosystem
in the Taigon. Winter and


49
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:34.489
Summer, these forests enjoy a special
microclimate with this own oxygen plant rich


50
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:40.039
and antimicrobial irons and fit inside.
Rich soils and a


51
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:45.649
great diversity of plants and animals
are to be found here. In a plentiful year,


52
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:51.379
the pine yields up to half a ton of
cones per hector which proves our


53
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:56.239
great peace of birds, animals and people
they like. 


54
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:05.839
The nuts present a very tasty and 
rich product and it used


55
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:11.509
to produce oil and milk. They much larger
than Siberian pine seeds and keep their


56
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:19.399
nutritional value longer. Probably be the
one is electrically area is beautiful it


57
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:28.219
which the cranials week. After the
collapse of the Soviet Union, coniferous


58
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:32.569
forests were very often the own
source of income for inhabitants of


59
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:42.019
remote villagers. People used to value and
protect the green pine. Local theaters


60
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:46.429
the infamous look of Russian capitalism
don’t. A new breed of people came to


61
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:51.439
the thai gosh, these were people who
wanted only to father their purses the


62
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:57.049
green pine capitalists. The looters of
the tigon pursuing short-term interests


63
00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:03.379
abroad chainsaws and went cutting into
the boards. However following a strong


64
00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:08.389
public protest, a ban was imposed on
industrial logging of pine in 1989.


65
00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:13.489
The natural father's the population of


66
00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:17.749
angulus which managed to survive in
conifer the city's forest was quick to


67
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:22.219
recover. The process which ran parallel
to the recovery of the in-law tiger


68
00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.459
which had suffered severe losses in the
war with man.


69
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:55.458
The start of the nineteen
nineties, so the iron curtain fall.


70
00:09:55.459 --> 00:09:59.809
The borders were open, premorial 
became in debt of the


71
00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:07.939
smugglers from nearby China, ready to buy
up the whole of the tigon. Nearly


72
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:12.648
every hunter went striking rich by
killing a tiger and selling his skin to


73
00:10:12.649 --> 00:10:19.369
Chinese buyers at fabulous prices.
Many were tempted to try their luck and


74
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:22.369
a new war on Tigers began.


75
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:32.889
new two is cool talking install million
you're only gonna crash down. Yet


76
00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:38.259
tigers brought fortune to nobody.
Hunters died in the Taiga as well


77
00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:43.569
some of them from the teeth and claws of
tigers they stopped. in the educated


78
00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:46.569
importantly spiritual existence
medically possible


79
00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:06.299
The repercussions of the tiger war could be
felt all over the world. In 1994, the


80
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:10.679
Worldwide Fund for Nature launched this
operation in the Russian parade with


81
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.679
the project designed to protect them or
tiger.


82
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:23.639
Upon the initiative, the
number of non-government organisations, a


83
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:29.338
special inspection team tiger were setup
which can initially endured with a broad


84
00:11:29.339 --> 00:11:35.759
scope of responsibilities. Seven
anti-poaching brigades are established


85
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:46.469
to protect anglers, the tigers’ prey. 
With the support of the WWF the Phoenix


86
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:52.828
Pond, inspectors managed to confiscate
78 tigers’ heart, over 30,000 poaches


87
00:11:52.829 --> 00:11:57.238
were obtained, 4,000
rifles were confiscated and over


88
00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:01.679
500 lawsuits were filed.


89
00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:14.279
Due to this joint effort, the community
managed to put an end to our treasure’s


90
00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:18.809
bridges of all limits by poachers and
succeeded in stabilizing the tiger


91
00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:22.949
population numbers around 450
individuals.


92
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.279
However the end of the Iron Curtain did
not found to bring evil, it also


93
00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.969
triggered rapid development of
international cooperation in the field


94
00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:33.989
of Science.


95
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:38.729
On the initiative of the Morris 
Honaker Institute and the


96
00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:42.869
Pacific Institute of Geography in the
Furies branch of the Russian Academy of


97
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:47.339
Sciences. The secretary Aldona
Reserve saw a successful launch of the


98
00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:52.319
Russian-American Amur Tiger project
which inaugurated invaluable practices


99
00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:58.379
capturing life Tigers inmobilizer then
the dots and transporting them to


100
00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:03.389
designated places. A new
breed of Russian professionals didn't


101
00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:07.619
take long to emerge
and thanks to an effective mix of


102
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:11.579
information from radio collars and
traditional tracking methods.


103
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:16.379
Scientists began to gather a large
amount of new data about tiger ecology.


104
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:21.659
This then formed the basis
for Russia's national strategy of amur


105
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.659
tiger conservation.


106
00:13:25.459 --> 00:13:28.749
science economics


107
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.749
this wasn't that


108
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:59.588
While his mother relaxes taking
her nap in the bushes away from the


109
00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:04.659
scorching sun and blood sucking
mosquitoes after an exhausting hunt, a


110
00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:13.509
well-fed offspring goes to play hunt
along the back of the stream. He regards


111
00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:17.708
himself quite grown-up, a big tiger who
can do everything for himself.


112
00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:28.919
However, for the time being, he's so awkward
that not only anguluars but the frogs from


113
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:40.648
the stream see him and run away in
dismay. This gives him huge


114
00:14:40.649 --> 00:14:44.938
pleasure at this stage of his
development, he sees in himself are


115
00:14:44.939 --> 00:14:47.938
terrible and all inspiring master of his
domain.


116
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:08.449
Still, some animals do not want to scare, 
it seems no need. They are 


117
00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:13.069
hunter seems to be spitten by the
proportions of an adult female red


118
00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:18.619
deer. Attempt to frighten a
Himalaya black bear and is in vain as well.


119
00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:23.239
But they will come
a day for the cub will undoubtedly see


120
00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.239
him again.


121
00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:37.309
Just then the true monster of
the realm becomes apparent. A


122
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:42.439
full grown male tiger is on a tour of
inspection around his property.


123
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:47.899
The tiger cub faces great danger who
knows the big tiger has on


124
00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:54.289
his mind what move his in. He's
not necessarily cub’s father. He might


125
00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:58.939
kill another tiger’s cub quite without
a second thought. In fact among


126
00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:03.349
tigers, even natural fathers do not
despite affection the formulas towards


127
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:08.209
their offspring and they're not avoid
and weary. The father’s


128
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:12.049
opposite female tigers are
ready to do anything for their cubs


129
00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:17.989
The cubs sake a mother tiger will challenge
male and considerably larger and


130
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:22.309
stronger animal but the big
male prefers not to have anything to do


131
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:28.939
with this protective mother. After
rolling his territory, there are many


132
00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:33.829
other shady Korean pines for him to rest
under. This family is lucky,


133
00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:38.449
their territory lies
inside a nature reserve where


134
00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:40.069
logging is illegal.


135
00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:45.049
However in Russia, protected areas makeup
just twenty percent of the tigers’


136
00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:48.679
habitat, so most other tigers are much
less lucky.


137
00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:08.588
Not every shot a poacher takes turns out
deadly ,wandering the forest so the


138
00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:13.658
Secretaria are a great number of
wounded animals. More or less every other


139
00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:19.479
tiger carries some ability and some sharp
under its skin. This exhausted and


140
00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:24.819
wounded animals unable to catch up a boar or deer
often secret villages and


141
00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:30.158
settlements in such an easy field.
The inspection tiger group set up a


142
00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.939
unit called calvic tiger which to deal
with such situations.


143
00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:38.319
However this time in
contrast to the nineteen eighties, the


144
00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:42.819
unit included not only good marksman but
biologists and scientists as well


145
00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:48.609
armed with their own special equipment.
This also a new game so drastic


146
00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:54.728
changes. From now on, every tiger appear in the
village or settlement would be


147
00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:59.619
frightened the way instead of shot, where
appearances reoccurred the invasion


148
00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:04.178
visitor would be captured and examined.
Any tiger who followed and attacked


149
00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:09.879
hunter will be captured at the find. And
ever the tiger should kill and eat


150
00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:14.469
the men, what he was subject to the
ultimate punishment of extermination.


151
00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:20.199
However, things fail to be so simple.
In the remote settlement


152
00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:24.699
of Trinivica, the situation for
capturing tiger who had been killing


153
00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:30.789
dogs seemed ideal. Snow that here was
so deep that the tiger had to plough his


154
00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:35.919
way through depths after his valley.
He could not cover that distances and


155
00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:42.609
had to make use of roads and leave tracks
which get him away without fail. However,


156
00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:48.188
traps failed to catch the tiger and
no tracks were found nearby the roads. 


157
00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:53.109
The following morning, news came
from a village 20 kilometers away that


158
00:18:53.110 --> 00:19:00.129
a dog had been attacked that night. New
traps were laid and people started to


159
00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:02.819
search following the roads.


160
00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:07.138
The next morning brought another message
about the morning attack on a dog in a


161
00:19:07.139 --> 00:19:15.599
different place. This pattern repeated
the south of a two torturous weeks.


162
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.168
The corporate work this patch
professionally, never to be seen


163
00:19:19.169 --> 00:19:23.579
more than once in any place. Never
returning to the scene I described,


164
00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:29.729
always staying away from rose.
The solution to this crime spree


165
00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:34.918
when it came was a surprise.
A railway


166
00:19:34.919 --> 00:19:39.178
linking local mining settlement
was being kept clean and maintain in good


167
00:19:39.179 --> 00:19:43.528
condition on the databases by diligent
railway workers. A


168
00:19:43.529 --> 00:19:47.579
perfect route for a tiger who made use
of this functional, practical


169
00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:53.878
infrastructure in Aberham to travel to
unexpected destination as a result


170
00:19:53.879 --> 00:19:56.878
this tiger was never captured.


171
00:19:58.559 --> 00:20:05.489
At another village, Rockavca,
the tiger tried to


172
00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:10.168
attack a car. Fortunate
victim's injuries were not serious


173
00:20:10.169 --> 00:20:12.748
for more than a few scratches.


174
00:20:12.749 --> 00:20:17.369
They stay unsettled 500
meters away from the farm. Apparently,


175
00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:20.878
this convince would be easier to wait for
waste products for slaughter to be


176
00:20:20.879 --> 00:20:24.329
done so he could eat when the coast
was clear.


177
00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:29.788
At first, he was keen for nobody
to detect him and attack him 


178
00:20:29.789 --> 00:20:33.748
on the cover of darkness. But
eventually he started to frequent the


179
00:20:33.749 --> 00:20:37.378
place at daylight and displayed no fear of evil.


180
00:20:37.379 --> 00:20:41.668
This type of behavior 
posed a serious threat not only


181
00:20:41.669 --> 00:20:46.018
to the livestock but now to people
themselves. On


182
00:20:46.019 --> 00:20:49.949
arriving at the village, the Calvic
tiger team had no difficulty in


183
00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:54.148
determining about the predator was
seriously ill. To shoot the lotter


184
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:59.308
would have represented no problem.
The tiger was hardly able to drag


185
00:20:59.309 --> 00:21:03.898
his feet along could not run at all and
will switch to something up to just a


186
00:21:03.899 --> 00:21:10.228
few jumps. It was easy to catch up with
him in the open field.


187
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:14.609
Nevertheless, the team took a courageous
decision to capture the tiger alive.


188
00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:20.038
The object was to give
him a thorough inspection and pronounce


189
00:21:20.039 --> 00:21:26.339
his condition only after a full medical
check-up. A trap was sat at his actual


190
00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.339
feeding place.


191
00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:37.279
The following day, the tiger was taken
into custody. He failed to show any


192
00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:41.869
resistance and display a strange
pattern of behavior, different to help


193
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:44.869
the tigers in a trap.


194
00:21:53.049 --> 00:21:56.618
The specialist immobilised the
tiger and conducted a thorough medical


195
00:21:56.619 --> 00:22:00.158
examination. Quick to establish that


196
00:22:00.159 --> 00:22:05.229
irreversible processes were away with no
chances of improvement, the team decided


197
00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:08.229
to put the tiger down by injection.


198
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:19.298
This gorgeous male tiger got into the 
apoachers now but


199
00:22:19.299 --> 00:22:23.649
he was not lucky enough to escape a sad
fate. He was found not quite a trouble,


200
00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:28.629
but by good people who did not touch him
and reported his discovery. 


201
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:33.339
The convict tiger team managed to combine the


202
00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:40.058
tiger was to the light. question you were
really cliquey but it's a lift sure you


203
00:22:40.059 --> 00:22:43.058
can associate a bit yourself


204
00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:55.239
Tiger was immobilised and delivered to a
special confined unity for treatment.


205
00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:59.558
After here successfully undergone a
series of treatment procedures to help


206
00:22:59.559 --> 00:23:03.879
him recover his health, he was
immobilized again fitted with a radio


207
00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:10.749
collar and deliver the full comfort to
his native hunting grounds.


208
00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:49.239
Ven aquí want to be rebooted but the
lesson of Virginia a tmobile. Nasty start


209
00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:53.769
of the third millenium, so
relations between man and the tiger rise


210
00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:55.269
to a new level.


211
00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:59.648
From then on, the death penalty
for convict tigers without


212
00:23:59.649 --> 00:24:02.648
investigation and trial will be
cancelled.


213
00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:45.999
It takes a tiger over a year to
muster all the intricacies of hunting


214
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.909
alone under the guidance of his or her mother.
At this stage, the target


215
00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:56.469
against the coming of age gains
independence has defined his or her own


216
00:24:56.470 --> 00:25:01.179
hunting ground, his territory. This 
is the most difficult task


217
00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:06.369
as the prime hunting grounds are
typically monopolised by adult tigers.


218
00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:13.688
A tigers hunting ground is not just a
section of forest, it is an area where he


219
00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:20.859
must catch and kill no less than 50
bunglers each year. Those that


220
00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:25.178
escaped and remain uneaten should
divide long enough to replenish the prey-stock


221
00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:28.239
and enable the tiger to know
enough shortages.


222
00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:41.709
Tagar is not supermarket, no animal
agrees laterally to prey a tiger


223
00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:47.079
even a skilled adult tiger
concludes many hunts without dinner


224
00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:53.979
though he may be king of the tagar and the 
other tiger is no long distance running,


225
00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:58.119
his strengths lies and sprints and rushes.


226
00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:21.459
Tigers fight with each
other for control of the best


227
00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:25.899
territories. Those who failed to fire 
the plot of land in the


228
00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:31.509
reserve do their best to settle in
hunting leases where wildlife biologists


229
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:34.509
have greatly increased angular numbers.


230
00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:57.489
The ambulition of the death
penalty is an historical milestone for tigers.


231
00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:01.058
Yet it pre-supposes the
establishment of special facilities


232
00:27:01.059 --> 00:27:05.229
for probation of these laws ship where
left straight and narrow.


233
00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:08.678
In theory this seems quite
understandable,


234
00:27:08.679 --> 00:27:12.699
however in practice things are far from
idea. All


235
00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:16.119
types of cubs are trying to survive
without the protection of their lost


236
00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:21.279
mothers regular come to villages to
catch stuffs such tigers


237
00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:26.319
first and to a private facility that
tiger special inspection unit. From now


238
00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:30.879
on, the heavy financial burdens of
treatment and feeding are taken on by a


239
00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:36.609
non-government organization. With the
castle powerscorin time, they still


240
00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:41.468
have a long way to go, not to prison 
but to another private facility


241
00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:46.509
based in herbarrow’s region at the
cliff rehabilitation center for wild


242
00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:51.009
animals. The tiger cub begins to


243
00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:56.019
shake over the stress of transportation
in a special cell or the done it is only


244
00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:59.019
to leave at night.


245
00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:28.199
Imagine by his reaction
to inanimate objects such as an


246
00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:32.849
automatic video camera, it has
been no performance so far. The tiger


247
00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:38.489
has retained in fear, a sign that he can
safely undergo rehabilitation treatment.


248
00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:44.579
When the small tiger against his
strength, a door is opened to lead


249
00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:48.839
into a spacious confined areas where he
will have to master the basics of


250
00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:55.559
hunting learning to catch real-life food
to eat. His reaction to video cameras


251
00:28:55.560 --> 00:29:00.509
confirms that the sub-adult tiger has
preserved fear of human beings


252
00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:03.959
which possess the main pre-requisite for his
survival in the wild.


253
00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:29.229
But what is to be done next? Will
he be placed in a zoo or


254
00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:36.219
center circus? In 2002, following an
initiative by the Wildlife Conservation


255
00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:40.719
Society. The inspection tiger unit
set out to conduct a bold


256
00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:45.879
experiment. Two young female
tigers who had undergone a complete cycle of


257
00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:49.449
rehabilitation where radio collar down
release back into the wild.


258
00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:34.609
His radio tracking data clearly
indicated that those tigresses had


259
00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:38.269
adopted quite well to the taigon.
Each of them had


260
00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:42.799
learnt to hunt on her own and succeeded
in obtaining enough meat to survive.


261
00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:48.319
Each of them had managed through
the confrontations but their’s. Neither


262
00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:52.908
of them came out to villages and no
attempts were made of catching dogs or goats.


263
00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:57.529
Despite this, the
fate of one of these tigresses is


264
00:30:57.530 --> 00:31:03.649
unknown. The callers suddenly went silent
several months later. The other tigress 


265
00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:08.509
managed to establish a hunting ground of
Iran which is solve through not only the


266
00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:13.159
winter but also the following spring and
summer hunting foreground wild boar.


267
00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:36.389
Till now, the fate of the more
tiger has been lying in the hands of the


268
00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:40.768
human citizens of pre-memorial will share
their territory with the tiger.


269
00:31:40.769 --> 00:31:48.359
The new edge has brought new troubles.
Now it is not only


270
00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:52.139
individual tigers, but the whole
tiger population that faces danger.


271
00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:14.688
The tigers living in this in
casting jepardy. The bound commercial


272
00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:19.729
Korean pine logging has been replaced
violately but also often predict so-called


273
00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:26.209
maintenance cuttings.
According to official WWF statistics, the


274
00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:30.409
20 hundreds sole cuttings of up to
half a million cubic meters of Korean 


275
00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:33.409
pine each year.


276
00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:42.149
Even this ban has been lifted according
to the new Russian forest code,


277
00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:54.689
now Korean tree forest in time
habited of the subject to merciless


278
00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:57.689
logging.


279
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:21.749
From the moment the first large appeared
on the banks of the more river know how


280
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:25.859
the Russian government has declared his or her
her personal commitment to the cause of


281
00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:33.208
tiger presentation. But one Summer,
Vladimir Putin set out on the journey to


282
00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:38.009
the Kronotsky Skin Natural Reserve to put
the high-tech GPS collar on an


283
00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:43.768
immobilised tiger having planted their
case on hair, she subsequently spoke


284
00:33:43.769 --> 00:33:48.329
about his government's responsibility
for the preservation of the title as a


285
00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:54.959
symbol of national heritage.
This case turned a new chapter in the


286
00:33:54.960 --> 00:34:01.018
history of relations between man and
the amur tiger. Today, three tigers


287
00:34:01.019 --> 00:34:05.729
where are their next satellite
analyse to put in helps


288
00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:09.868
the academic research projects in one
reserve will spill over into a


289
00:34:09.869 --> 00:34:13.648
long-term national conservation program
supported by the Russian government.


290
00:34:28.168 --> 00:34:33.417
As the Ausurial coniferous forests commonly


291
00:34:33.418 --> 00:34:38.637
known as they Tigon stretch out to
meet the Pacific Ocean. The brown bear


292
00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:43.259
begins to lose his status as the
national symbol of Russian.


293
00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:49.348
There in the ridges of secret alien mountains,


294
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:56.188
the bear meets his great rival, the amur
tigon, the proud, solitary and animatic


295
00:34:56.190 --> 00:35:01.618
predator. The amur tiger is one of the
largest of all the tiger sub-species on


296
00:35:01.619 --> 00:35:07.259
earth and the early one which survives
in the deep snowdrifts. Few other countries


297
00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:11.729
in the world can boast such great
treasures.


298
00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:25.529
We were busy with the final credits when
a call for action came in the studio in


299
00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:29.879
the vicinities of the city of Asterisk.
An adult tiger was visiting a hunting


300
00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:34.499
base at night causing the frightened
watchman to call the helpline of the


301
00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:39.419
Department for hunting inspection and a
special inspection tiger unit. By the


302
00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:43.739
time the specialist arrived, the tiger
had been found maniacally prosecuting


303
00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:48.928
slowly looking traffic trying to bite it’s 
wheels. The behavior of this


304
00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:54.209
tiger was clearly abnormal. Such an
unusual tiger definitely perth a threat


305
00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:57.658
to the residents of the nearby settlemet
of Alisvaka. As a


306
00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:02.367
result, a decision was taken to
immobilise the beast to examine him


307
00:36:02.369 --> 00:36:08.159
formally. The tiger display the
same pattern of behavior as a tiger who had


308
00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:11.818
died the previous year in the clear
rehabilitation center.


309
00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:17.009
However there is no need for 
drawing any preliminary conclusions or making any


310
00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:20.549
other pronouncements on his
health. After the


311
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:24.719
tongue had been placed in special cage,
biological samples were taken to


312
00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:28.347
determine whether there were any
possible viral infections or other


313
00:36:28.349 --> 00:36:34.709
causes of such abnormalities. The pattern
of behavior of this tiger greatly


314
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:38.879
resembled one that was observed in the
tiger last year on the flight of a Star


315
00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:44.639
Cabarrus Highway where the tiger cause
jams and posed a hurdle to traffic. He


316
00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:49.198
was captured delivered to the Cliff
Rehabilitation Center and died there despite


317
