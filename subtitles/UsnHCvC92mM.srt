1
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:21,720
In bustling Surabaya, on the Indonesian island
of Java, this is a hot ticket, particularly

2
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,110
at the weekend. It'll cost you a dollar fifty
to step inside the Surabaya Zoo and join the

3
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:39,940
crowd. And every week 10,000 people wander
through what was once considered one of the

4
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:46,920
best zoos in South East Asia.

5
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:53,620
It's a relatively affordable day out for local
families who appear to enjoy themselves but

6
00:00:54,620 --> 00:01:00,230
seem oblivious to the condition of the residents
and their enclosures.

7
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:07,780
These days, Surabaya Zoo is more of a house
of horrors than a wildlife wonderland. : "I

8
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:14,750
think Surabaya Zoo is one of the zoos
that never been approved as a zoo because

9
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,680
the facility and the condition of the animal
is not good at all".

10
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,890
"I reckon right now it should be quarantined.
I think it should be closed. They need to

11
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,840
step in now and they need to quarantine that
place right now. It's a

12
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:36,310
disease carrying death zoo".

13
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:47,300
Sri Penta has the unenviable task of trying
to care for the zoo's residents as best she can.

14
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,470
And as this sunny, energetic curator shows

15
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:06,110
us around, it's clear that the job in front
of her is overwhelming."The animals died suddenly.

16
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:11,840
The cause varies - the number of animals in
the cage...

17
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,750
too many males within a group... the health
factor... the poor environmental conditions

18
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:23,280
in the cages... these are probably some of
the factors that caused the death of the animals".

19
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:39,090
Everywhere you look, there are stark and confronting
examples of animals in squalid, cramped conditions.

20
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:50,900
Australian camels appear sick and emaciated.
Australian pelicans are crammed in wing to wing.

21
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,450
Some animals appear to be begging to be let
out.

22
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:10,150
"Well, we're close to the animals on a daily
basis -

23
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:17,280
and when there are so many deaths within the
last three months, of course, we felt very

24
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:24,310
disappointed. We feel a sense of loss".

25
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,030
About 50 animals have died
in just three months, including this adult

26
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:39,860
orang-utan on the day we arrived.

27
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:49,120
Beyond these walls Indonesia's orang-utans
in Borneo and Sumatra are endangered. This

28
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,040
baby male orang-utan may survive. His parents
rejected him so he's being kept away from

29
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,880
the zoo's other diseased apes. It's extraordinary
that they've escaped human threats in the

30
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:07,840
wild, but here in a place they should be safe
and healthy, they're anything but.

31
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:19,830
: "Most of all because of the holding facility
they've got is very poor. The humidity is

32
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:26,630
very high and they are very dark inside and
it's easily transmit diseases one

33
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:33,630
to the others and the second thing is, the
exhibit is very old, mostly left over by Dutch

34
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:37,890
maybe 50 years or 70 years ago".

35
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:50,140
Tony Sumampau is one of Indonesia's most respected animal experts, and he's particularly concerned
about some vitally important residents - Surabaya

36
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:57,960
Zoo's Sumatran tigers.: "They have no room
for exercise, for these three tigers in Surabaya Zoo.

37
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,560
They have no sunlight when they are growing,

38
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:09,250
so until now they don't have any facility
for them to exercise, to climb the tree, to

39
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:15,590
going up, jump up and jump down and things
like that - that makes their muscle becoming

40
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:22,600
weaker and weaker every day and the food is
not very good as well".

41
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,090
The appalling condition of the zoo's Sumatran
tiger population is perhaps the most difficult

42
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:37,390
to comprehend. These magnificent creatures
should be the pride of Indonesia, the dominant

43
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:45,800
predator among the country's exotic species.
But populations have been devastated by development

44
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,060
and poaching. Here at the zoo though, the
picture is no more positive for this critically

45
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:02,130
endangered animal. "In regard to diseases
that are inside that zoo,

46
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:07,900
there's tuberculosis, there's hepatitis...
and the animals are also dying of pneumonia".

47
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:16,900
There are thought to be only about three to
four hundred Sumatran Tigers left in the wild.

48
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:23,000
In here, 15 share their cramped quarters with
others like this Bengal Tiger.

49
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,200
Sri Penta has seen the best and worst of this
place in her 20 years here. Now, though, it's

50
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:42,080
so bad she's risking her job showing us the
conditions the tigers are still kept in.

51
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:49,500
"Why is it not good for the tigers?""It is
not good because the cage is too small, their

52
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:56,300
resting pen is too small, and humid, as you
can see the floor can't dry, it's humid

53
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:09,400
and the sun can't get inside. So health-wise
it's not good, it's not healthy, and in the

54
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,990
future it will have an impact on the health
of the animals".

55
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:17,450
"They're going to die. I have no doubt that
they'll die.

56
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:24,000
It is absolutely atrocious what they're doing
in this zoo".

57
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The dire plight of Surabaya's tigers has enraged
animal conservationists around the world.

58
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,430
Australian Sybelle Foxcroft is one who came
to Indonesia to try to help, drawn by one

59
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:51,190
awful life and death struggle, the case of
tigress Melani. "At Surabaya Zoo she was kept

60
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:58,950
in what I could equate to a dungeon. They
did that because the public were horrified

61
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,360
but then they didn't
really do anything about her and they left

62
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,570
her there for a very long time. So she didn't
get any sunlight, she didn't get anything".

63
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:14,100
Melani and three other Sumatran tigers were
malnourished and kept in cramped conditions.

64
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:28,390
Then in 2008 they were fed meat contaminated
with the preservative formaldehyde.

65
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:41,440
Three tigers died. Incredibly Melani lived...
but only just. And she'd endure five years

66
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,440
of suffering before a public clamour finally
brought government intervention, her evacuation

67
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:57,200
from the zoo and proper treatment.
Sybelle Foxcroft was instrumental in getting

68
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:06,750
Melani out of Surabaya. "She's a creature
that has been neglected and abused inside

69
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,250
a zoo that is deemed to care for her.

70
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:17,360
She's just woken up this morning and she's
not wanting to eat freely like she normally

71
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,880
does, but she's probably looking at everybody
also, being distracted, but her feeding can

72
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:29,750
take up to about two hours and this is kind
of normal also, but at the moment she just

73
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:34,330
doesn't seem that hungry".
Melani is recovering at a place called Taman

74
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:41,500
Safari Park outside Bogor, about a two hour
drive south of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.

75
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:48,210
"Well she's
so very frail from her ordeal with this poison

76
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:52,750
and then starvation. The starvation caused
her body to start

77
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:59,000
consuming her own organs so right now she's
struggling to live".

78
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,380
Taman Safari is owned and run by
Tony Sumampau and it's dramatically different

79
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:22,720
to Melani's old home in Surabaya.
It spans 150 hectares and looks less like

80
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:29,290
a zoo and more like a faithful recreation
of a wild animal's natural setting.

81
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:41,170
Resident tigers can stretch their legs in relatively
wide open spaces and when they need attention

82
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:46,750
or when wild tigers are brought here injured
after a run in with a poacher, there are sophisticated

83
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:53,500
facilities at an on site animal hospital.
"Genetically they are very nice. They are

84
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:59,250
a wild tiger in fact
so it's good to keep their young to release

85
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:05,630
them in the wild which is very important".The
Safari Park is looking after 28 Sumatran tigers

86
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:09,610
who are
under threat."Well someone poisoned him when

87
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:16,510
he was quite young, less than two years old
I think"."So he's angry with humans since

88
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:23,100
that I suppose".: "Yeah, but I thought he
was going to die at that time, but hopefully

89
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:32,890
he's recovered from the poisons and become
a real tiger now"."A real man"."A real man".

90
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:48,870
The success of Taman Safari leaves Surabaya
in the shade with 1.8 million visitors a year,

91
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:53,280
it pulls in tens of millions of dollars on
ticket sales alone.

92
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:59,150
There's restaurants and rides, as well as
merchandise and a kind of side show alley

93
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:06,610
area that's clearly a profit machine. With
that, the park employs 750 staff and provides

94
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:13,700
well for its animals. So around about now
you might be wondering why Tony Sumampau hasn't

95
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:20,300
been called in to sort out the mess
at Surabaya. The short answer is he has, or

96
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:31,800
or rather had, and the experience goes some way to explaining the intractable problems gripping the zoo in Java and imperilling its Sumatran tigers.

97
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:45,000
It's a rat's nest of vested interests, power struggles, nepotism, ineptitude and disinterest.

98
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:58,070
"I think the Surabaya Zoo is
more likely a management conflict between

99
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:05,570
one management
team and the other team"."But why are the

100
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:14,380
animals in such poor condition?": "Well, because
they don't understand about the animal welfare

101
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,460
issue".
Tony Sumampau was enlisted to fix Surabaya

102
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:25,770
Zoo back in 2010. He says he tried to establish
programs to better train zoo keepers to care

103
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:32,120
for animals and tried to rebuild or renew
animal enclosures, but money was scant and

104
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:38,490
so was goodwill. The zoo is staffed by people
with family connections and he says the animals'

105
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:45,600
interests just don't rank as a priority.
"They don't really know how to manage the

106
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:55,210
zoo but they're just thinking of gaining some
money from the visitor for the purpose of

107
00:13:55,210 --> 00:14:01,000
their own welfare, not the animal welfare.
The things that make the Surabaya Zoo is getting worse and worse".

108
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,220
"It was founded and built using public money
from an idea by journalists at the time. And

109
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:17,890
it grew to become one of the biggest zoos
in South East Asia".

110
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:23,950
Earlier this year Tony Sumampau was kicked
out by this woman - the formidable but very

111
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:30,100
popular Mayor of Surabaya - Tri Rismaharani.

112
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:40,700
The Surabaya Municipal Council is responsible
for running the zoo and owns the land it occupies.

113
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:47,290
The Mayor claims a lifelong interest in the
place.

114
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:56,630
"When I was little, my grandpa always me to
come along to the zoo, and that's why during

115
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:00,550
junior high school I joined the Surabaya Zoo
Lovers Club.

116
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:07,600
When I came to the zoo, the condition was
worse than it was when I was little".

117
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:14,580
Mayor Rismaharani hurled a barrage of accusations
at Tony Sumampau, claiming he was secretly

118
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:20,210
planning to develop the zoo into a luxury
holiday resort and that he was trafficking animals.

119
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:29,210
"One year ago the team came to me, and said

120
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:38,500
there were not enough funds for the maintenance
of the zoo. They wanted to build a hotel...

121
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:47,170
a restaurant. That's when I got upset - why
did I get upset? Because the zoo is the pride

122
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,460
of the Surabaya people".

123
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:59,050
"This is just silly you know? I'm helping
for free not for the... for stealing animals

124
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:04,270
inside the zoo. If I wanted to get the animal
I can ask the Minister - I like this animal

125
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:10,600
- then I can get it just for free, but I've
never done that, you know. But they keep accusing

126
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:16,360
me like that. I don't know why"."So you never
took a proposal to them about a hotel?""No,

127
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:23,080
never. Never. I've never seen one too".

128
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:27,990
Critics of the mayor in turn claim she has
her own development plans for the central

129
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:34,410
city site. They accuse her of interfering
for years in its affairs before taking personal

130
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:39,900
control of the zoo, even though she has no
expertise in the field.

131
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:46,600
"I think time will tell if what we do is right
or wrong. Conditions were bad back then.

132
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,020
I had to deploy 5000 municipal employees...
to clean the cages... to scrub the cages...

133
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:03,200
to mend the broken cages... to clean up the
water tanks. There were five thousand people".

134
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:10,270
It's difficult to reconcile the Mayor's catalogue
of activity with what we saw at the zoo. In

135
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:17,500
the sweltering Indonesian heat, animals still
swam in and drank from heavily polluted water.

136
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:23,970
The mayor has declined offers of assistance
and expert advice from animal welfare groups.

137
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:32,590
"About.. over a year ago I wrote to the Mayor
and basically asked her to please, you know,

138
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:40,590
implement some humane care in Surabaya Zoo
and... you know along those lines, just trying

139
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:46,890
to be supportive as well and offering aid....
and I didn't get a response from her".

140
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:54,900
"Why do you think the Mayor has refused help?"
"I have no idea. I do not know why she's refusing

141
00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:03,050
help. She has been offered help from a lot
of organisations around the world and my impression

142
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:09,420
that I'm getting is that she's done some very
good work around but she is not.... she's

143
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:15,130
got engineering degrees and city planning
degrees. She is not an animal skilled person.

144
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:23,970
She is not a zoologist or a wildlife-ologist
or any animal ethics qualifications at all.

145
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:28,300
She's got to leave this one alone and allow
the professionals to get in there and fix

146
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:35,200
these animals or else they are going to continue
to die".

147
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,450
And as claim and counter claim volley from
one side of Indonesia to the other, the animals

148
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:49,590
continue to suffer and die.

149
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:54,830
In some ways the strife at Surabaya Zoo is
emblematic of the nation's

150
00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:02,600
vexed and sometimes hostile relationship with
its wildlife, where humans and development prevail and animals lose.

151
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:20,610
Out here in the wilds of Sumatra the tiger
has roamed for thousands of years but vast

152
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:27,540
swathes of its jungle territory are being
turned into farming land. Indonesia's burgeoning

153
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:36,400
population has pushed ever deeper into the
tiger's natural domain."Even in the wild,

154
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,920
when we're helping
the tiger conflict, villagers are complaining

155
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:46,700
'Why do you only think about the wildlife
that are taking our livestock? Why not you

156
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:55,640
think about our life?', you know."
We're on our way to Sesiro in north western

157
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:01,420
Sumatra. Like many villages it's carved out
of the jungle wilderness, and like some, it's

158
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:10,950
got its own tiger tale to tell.
Sesiro's home to about 600 people. It's not

159
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:17,360
the poorest of places in Sumatra - the local
rubber industry offers plenty of work. Villagers

160
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:24,210
who run small subsistence farms here worry
about losing stock to wild animals. Recently,

161
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:30,880
though, a tiger claimed a human life.

162
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,240
Adi and his friends work the local rubber
plantations, but illegally harvesting sandalwood

163
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,960
from deep in the national park is a tempting
sideline that can earn a year's salary in

164
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:49,240
quick time. On a trip into the jungle hoping
to strike it lucky, they came under attack

165
00:20:49,240 --> 00:21:00,700
from a group of Sumatran tigers.
"One of our friends got separated from us

166
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:07,310
and we saw the tiger get hold of him. We saw
that tiger. And we looked to the other side.

167
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:14,700
There was another tiger coming at us, so we
hurriedly climbed up the trees".

168
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,170
From that vantage point they saw their friend
mauled to death.

169
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:26,000
"I've been working a long time in the jungle
and this was the first time I saw that".

170
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,900
The fatal attack horrified the men and traumatised
the village, but the experience made them

171
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:42,420
respect the tiger and its territory in a way
they'd never thought of before.

172
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:52,400
They're not the only ones thinking about the
tiger. Slowly the country's tigers are getting attention.

173
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:04,410
"In the past, for decades, in Indonesian
culture,

174
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:11,410
people used to feel so proud having tiger's
skin in their house. They were proud owning

175
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:18,200
elephant tusk. People were also proud to be
able to hunt tigers. And those habits aren't
easy to let go".

176
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,420
Indonesia's Forestry Minister, Zulkifli Hasan,
has come to check the conservation efforts

177
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:41,470
at Taman Safari Park. His ministry makes the
rules and regulations for zoos but even a

178
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:46,570
powerful national politician has found it
difficult to solve the Surabaya mess.

179
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:55,570
"To revitalise it, to improve the way to manage
the zoo, renovating the cages would take an

180
00:22:55,570 --> 00:23:02,460
immense amount of funds. And the entrance
tickets alone won't cover it. The local government's

181
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:09,500
allocated budget of four billion rupees isn't
enough either. So we need time".

182
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:19,760
And as if financial and management problems
weren't enough, now nature is throwing in

183
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:26,100
more problems - evidence is emerging of a
disease developing in already scant wild tiger

184
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:33,500
populations that attacks the nervous system
and eventually kills the animal.

185
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:39,250
It's just one reason why so much is depending
on the success of a special breeding program

186
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:46,420
at Taman Safari Park. When Foreign Correspondent
was visiting the park, vets performed the

187
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:53,500
first artificial insemination of a Sumatran
tiger in Indonesia.

188
00:23:54,500 --> 00:24:03,320
Semen from a sedated wild male has been injected
into a wild female. If the operation is a

189
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:10,160
success, the program could help keep the wild
Sumatran tiger population alive.

190
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,290
"I would think now the tiger's number is really at around 300...
350, nothing more than that.

191
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:25,590
If we can't save the habitat of the tigers
we might lose the tiger in another 30-40 years.

192
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:34,460
They will disappear in the wild, except in
the zoo".

193
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:47,550
A great deal rests on the survival of Melani,
the tigress as well. If she can survive the

194
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:53,150
ordeal she suffered at Surabaya Zoo it will
inspire and encourage all those who've worked

195
00:24:53,150 --> 00:25:00,000
so hard to save her.
"She's a critically endangered Sumatran Tiger.

196
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:12,830
She has the ability to show affection to the
very species that hurt her so - and to see

197
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:17,330
an animal struggle
through this sort of thing, you know she wants

198
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:23,230
to live. It's her will
that's keeping her alive. She's a survivor

199
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:30,000
and her nature is so very gentle and beautiful". Subtitles End: mo.dbxdb.com
